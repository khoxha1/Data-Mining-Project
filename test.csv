"Overall, I do like it. I like the idea of putting real petals inside the bottle. The toner does its job (balancing and hydrating my skin). For the price, I think it worths.",1
I have oily skin and prior to argan I was using coconut oil on my face. Decided I needed to switch up since coconut oil tends to clog pores (very minor instances for me). I’ve had absolutely no issues w/ argan. It soaks in quickly and no break outs! I plan to continue using this product but the price is hard to justify. I can’t say that it’s changed my fine lines around my eyes but then probably only one thing will... I like this nonetheless.,2
"I got a deluxe sample a while back and plan on buying the full size when it runs out. I usually use Mediheal’s NMF sheet mask and this mask is pretty similar in terms of hydration, even if they have different ingredients. So I use them for different purposes- the sheet mask is when my skin is fatigued and stressed, the Fresh mask for basic hydration and to give just an extra oomph. I actually don’t really like the smell of rose, my nose is very sensitive. So while I despise the way it smells in the jar, once you put it on your face it’s not so bad. I’m glad I discovered this because it’s less wasteful than using sheet masks all the time.",1
"This cleanser is great.  It actually emulsifies, which a lot of oil cleanser don’t do.  It does a great job of melting away your makeup and it’s actually really easy to wash off the face.   It leaves your face feeling cleansed but not dry.  My biggest complaint it that the size of the bottle is absolutely tiny for $45.  Ridiculous.  This product was gifted by Dermalogica for my review.",1
"I bought the small bottle of this to try it out - I have combination skin and am prone to breakouts so I was afraid to put oil on my face. Now I’m a little addicted to it! Honestly, it makes my face soft and moisturized, but it never feels oily. I use it on my hands as well - same story. So glad I tried this and can’t wait to try the SPF version when this bottle runs out.",2
I really like this product. I’m no make up guru list an ordinary mom trying to look passable. This gave my b.m powder foundation a more full coverage which was nice. The texture is thick but then spread easy. It doesn’t make your face feel sticky or most importantly dry or oily. I really like it. Esp since I need more coverage around my eyes with this i didn’t have to put on 100 layers! I recieved this from infuensrer to try so I don’t know about price  but it is def a win for me!,1
Most Amazing cleanser I have used! The price range is so affordable & amazing and so hydrating I’ve already used 2 bottles and will continue to keep using!,2
I brought a sample of this moisturizer after reading all the reviews. I had high expectations on this cream but it put me down. I had so many breakouts just after using this cream for once. Skin did feel hydrated but breakouts were the worst. I will not recommend this cream.,0
"Magic all I can say is that this is magic. I put them on a pimple when it’s very swollen before going to sleep and in the morning thr pimple is almost gone. I couldn’t believe it. The other day I got a blemish on my back that sorry for the exact description but those you cannot squezze, they are so swollen that even hurts touching it. well I put one dot at around 12 pm by 8 pm I had nothing. it was magic honestly. really recommend these for those especial ocassions that the blemish is just a nightmare.",2
"I bought this based on the rave reviews, since using Accutane I’ve been a drying mess so I thought this could be the answer. This is a great nightly moisturizer, but I would not suggest using it as a moisturizer before foundation if you have oily skin; the oils from your skin and the Argan oil will change your foundation color. Overall, I’d say its a good product but not Holy Grail.",1
leaves skin feeling great! does exactly what it says,2
I was sold on this product when I read a review and the girl said that [my boyfriend saw me and said that I looked beautiful and glowing.] In my head I just “awwww-ed“ because I found that to be just so adorable. This product really does supply a glow and effectively removes ALL of my makeup. The container feels luxurious and I love the sound that is made when I screw the top on and off the glass base.,2
I received this product free for review from Influenster and have been loving it!! My skin was visibly smoother with a much more even texture after just one use. I am excited to see how much my skin continues to improve with more use. The smell is very nice but also subtle. I do tend to have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritate me at all. Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out and recommending to my friends as well!,2
"i received a sample of this for christmas and used it as my face wash for a few months. i have dry skin with blackheads and occasional whiteheads. i pared down to a very simple routine: cleanse with this oil, then apply lush’s imperialis lotion. the cleanser didn’t remove my (washable, non-waterproof) mascara every single time, but it did significantly clear up my skin.i’m using up other face washes right now, but i would repurchase this product. despite being a well-documented cheapskate, i think it’s worth the money because it made my skin look noticeably better.",1
"just i have no words to describe this overnight glow peel . in the morning my skin looks like perfectly , shining like a diamond surely . i don’t believe that this glycolic peel makes my skin glow and fresh. i have dry skin and recommended it for everyone , it exfoliates and brightens skin when we sleep .",2
"This is a fantastic scrub. My skin felt polished and smooth afterwards. But it’s not at all harsh. It did not strip my skin, just made it feel like marble afterwards! It’s pretty amazing.",2
"This product is incredible! It takes all the makeup off my face. I have never had such luck with a product like this. Just make sure to clean your face very well afterwards, because it may cause breakouts if not.",2
"i had very disgusting pimples on my forehead. i used this for about two weeks and they seriously cleared up. I wash my face with warm water, scrub this on my forehead, leave it on for a min, and it does its job! it is drying so u have to moisturizer after.",1
"Definitely highly disappointed in the size, for the price it’s not worth the buy.",0
"Honestly I think this serum is a bit overpriced, there’s other vitamin c oils that I like more. I felt that this one was a bit too heavy and caused some minor breakdowns due to the amount of oil.",1
"My favourite lip balm. If you want a lip balm with a shine and a good smell i would recommend although, if you do not like lip gloss i wouldn’t recommend this for you. The smell is amazing and adds a very smell amount of pink, it makes it look very natural.",2
got this as a VIB rewards sample absolutely love it especially in the winter time,2
I received this complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. This is a very gentle exfoliator. I love that it has Papaya & Salicylic Acid. This didn’t irritate my skin at all. It feels so soothing when massaging it on your skin. This has helped tremendously with my breakouts.,2
I bought this cleanser to try out after having some issues with my previous one drying and stripping my skin. I absolutely love this. It has a nice cooling effect on your face and smells like cucumbers. It does not dry out my dry skin and leaves it feeling silky after each use. It also does a great job of removing my makeup after a full days use. Would definitely recommend!,2
"I know this will upset some folks but I’ve tried a LOT of various skin care products in my life. This literally feels just like a thicker version of the original Oil of Olay age defying face cream-- it even has the same smell.. mind you, it’s very faint, but if you were to smell them side by side I think you’d agree!! LOL I’m 40 years old so I understand the younger women might have no idea what I’m talking about, but if you’re my age... honestly.. it’s kinda crazy to me that this is $100 for something that feels almost the same as a $15 for 2oz competitor. I dunno... I’m having a hard time being impressed with this one for the outrageous price. There’s just sooooo many other great products out there in this $100 price point that do the same thing AND they have SPF.",1
"I use this product every night to take off my makeup. I works so well and the best part is , it smells amazing",2
"I know a lot of people stray from physical exfoliants, but this is a really nice one. It doesnt dry my skin out and it has a really fresh scent. The luffa fruit is gentle and my skin feels very nice and afterwards. I don’t use it every day, and it’s lasted several months so the price is definitely solid. It helps to remove that makeup and oil from my skin before bed, and I feel like it’s a good prep before serums and moisturizers.",1
"I suffer from cystic acne and have found these to be incredibly helpful in expediting the healing process. I’m very realistic about what these are capable of - they will NOT vanish your cystic acne pimples overnight. They perhaps can if the pimple is not cystic and has an opening. But for cystic acne, I find these to be the most effective in the very beginning when the pimple is forming. If it has already budded and there is no opening, these won’t be as effective. However, once that opening shows up, these dots suck all of the gunk out of there, cutting my cystic acne life cycle in half.",2
The holy grail lip mask. Totally lives up to the hype.,2
This made my lips feel so moisturized throughout the day and the color gave my lips a nice rosy tint. I like to use this on days when my lips just need a little hint of color. I will be keeping this in my makeup bag as a go to lip product! #complimentaryfromfresh,2
"Easy to apply and goes on smooth, although I thought the product was pretty watery and left my skin kind of greasy. Definitely make sure you shake before you use or you’ll just get a runny clear substance. Love the smell, that it rubs in clear, the spf and the fact that it is water and heat resistant. Will continue to use but not sure I would repurchase.",1
I actually am a big fan of this gloss. It is not sticky and does not dry out my lips like a lot of glosses do. It leaves a nice shine on my lip and has a nice subtle flavor. I would use this product again— I received it as a complimentary gift. It’s a little more expensive than some other glosses— but the quality is there.,2
"I wasn’t intrigued by this product at all, but while looking for relief from congested pores in mature skin, i read the product reviews and decided to try this. It works great, and i like the fact that it’s concentrated and efficient. I also use this on my scalp for scalp irritation. Yep, it smells like tea tree oil, but oh well.",1
This eye bomb is literally the bomb! It is so lightweight yet effective and the scent is pleasant. I’ve tried other brands on eye creams that have failed to truly impress me but this moisturiser really delivers.,2
"This moisturizer is super moisturizing and doesn’t feel greasy, which makes me so sad that it caused me to break out in TERRIBLE cystic acne. For the past 2 months since I purchased I started getting terrible cystic pimples (at least 3 at a time) along my chin and jawline - I stopped using this and after 2 weeks nearly all of the cystic acne is gone. Not sure whats wrong but this was the only product I got rid of and it fixed the acne/",0
"I really do like this product but it’s not quite as hydrating as I need. The dewy moisturizer is just a bit too heavy. The scent is absolutely lovely, though.",1
I love this lotion i have been using it for over 2 years now its fast absorbing and doesn’t clog my pores. However you will need something heavier during the winter but its perfect for summer. It is worth buying the bigger size.,2
Didn’t like this. The niacinamide is nice but doesn’t make it worth $45 or worth the pilling. This was a return for me.,1
Melted my makeup off and didn’t break me out. Feel super velvety on the skin. I do wish it had a little more slip because it can feel like I’m tugging on my skin. Over all really good,1
I had a horrible skin reaction to this product. I was breaking out all over and my skin became irritated to the point that even splashing water on my face was painful! I don’t recommend this product at all.,0
I love this cleanser!! It feels refreshing and my skin feels clean without feeling stripped. I do only use it at night and switch to the AHA/BHA Exfoliating cleanser in the morning.,2
I have tried everything. I have breakouts and sensetive skin and even dr rx creams havent helped. I tried cheap to expensive...and heard of this oil actually for my hair...its great on my hait btw....but is super fabulous for my face...no more breakouts and my skin feels amazing...i added cream on top of the oil when out in the cold weather and its great...Cant say enough about htis stuff.,2
"I bought this cream in the hopes that it would help my extreme dry skin. I saw nice results the first few days but then my skin went back to being dry. I don’t think it’s the best cream for dry skin but it’s still pretty amazing. I use this on rotation with another cream that did resolve my dry skin issues and I like how it makes my skin feel and look. I love the texture, it’s hydrating enough and when I use this at night, I wake up with a nice bright complexion. Overall a great cream. I’ll probably enjoy it more this summer when my skin won’t be dry.",2
"A nice gentle exfoliant. I have oily/acne prone skin so this works great for me. I also love that it is cruelty-free! I don’t exfoliate every day, usually a few times a week. This is a great addition to my routine! Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.",2
Works super fast without overdrying!!,2
"I’ve not noticed any dramatic changes, but do feel it leaves my skin clean.",1
"The serum is amazing! It is lightweight serum which absorbs so quickly, doesn’t leave a sticky feeling or any other type of residue. It didn’t make my skin break out, definitely made my skin feel more bounce and firmness to it.",2
Jaksiie lopIKmm siewq 2390 bcxdo!! Kiermn ksmeopm awqsxzl.,2
DR. DENNIS GROSS SKINCAREAlpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peelexclusive works amazing for skin. I noticed brighter clearer skin right away.,1
"I was provided cream through bzz agent for a promotional review.  I used this cream daily for 2 weeks.  After first use my skin felt soft.  After one week, my dry skin was not as dry and  was holding good moisture throughout the day!  After two weeks my face felt soft and smooth!  The product does not leave a greasy or gritty residue.  My skin absorbed this soft elixir.  What a great product! Creates confidence:)",2
"After my very first use, I saw immediate change to my skin. Great for sensitive skin and cleared up my pores overnight. Great to use daily and absolutely love this product!",2
"This moisturizer is a must. It’s light and doesn’t clog pores, it’s also hypo-allergenic for those with sensitive skin.",1
"This is a good hydrating toner however I’ve finished my bottle and it’s just not my favorite. Its and ok toner, but I wasn’t very impressed.",1
"I absolutely love this product, I have really dry skin and have struggled with it for so long. After using tatcha dewy for only a month my skin is hydrated and clear!! I was skeptical because of all the other reviews but if you have dry skin this is the one for you!!",2
"The Coconut Water wipes are very gentle and do remove face make up effectively. Not so much with waterproof mascara, but I did not expect it to handle that.  I wish there were more in a package for the price.",1
"This eye cream is a wonderful addition to my daily routine! It’s gentle enough to use every day, and I loved the smooth texture and cooling applicator. An absolutely amazing eye cream - highly recommend!",2
I’m not one to usually use eye balms but I was kindly gifted this one and instantly fell in love. I thought it was the perfect consistency and not too heavy/uncomfortable under my eye!,1
This is my favorite cleansing balm!!! It doesn’t feel like oil like some do. It’s smooth and takes off all makeup. The only thing is it’s expensive and I went through it pretty fast. I probably won’t buy again I will buy the inkey list oat cleanser which does the job for $10. If you have the money though this stuff feels amazing I would consider it a luxury item.,2
"I received a sample of this product to try from Influenster and it was about a weeks worth so I can’t comment on how this product works long term. It did make my skin glowey and it felt hydrated in the morning. I didn’t notice any crazy differences but again, it’s probably because I didn’t use it for a longer period of time. It is pretty pricey so I’m not sure I would buy!",1
HOLY COW. LIFE-CHANGING. You know how sometimes you use a product and you’re like did it work? Do I notice a difference? This one you 100% notice a difference after the first use. My skin texture was SO SMOOTH. I have keratosis pilaris on my cheeks and it was reduced significantly!! Incredible!! Nothing ever seems to help with it. I have tried hundreds of products. I am so sold on this product even though the price tag is high. Please give it a chance and try if you have uneven skin texture!!! It works miracles.,2
"This was really bad. It’s pretty much overrated Vaseline, but Vaseline actually works. This not only feels like a ton of sticky lipgloss on your lips but it actually dries them out more! This went into the trash after reading other bad reviews since I thought that only happened to me. Never again.",0
really good moisturizer for the winter considering its thick but its not oily so i’m guessing its good for the summer as well,2
This makeup remover is the best I’ve ever used. It got off every stitch of makeup and sunscreen and is so gentle. I don’t have to rub anywhere. It glides on and you just massage it gently around your face. It rinses clean. Fun to use! I look forward to taking my makeup and sunscreen off now.,2
"First of all, I love the scent! Smells like peaches. The scent doesn’t linger too Long. I do not have sensitive skin so I can used twice a day which I notice has left my face feeling so polished and looking like glass. Really minimized my pores also. I’ve noticed the most substantial difference after using this product immediately after a steamy shower while my pores are open. It did leave my skin red however that too returned to normal after 15 min. I love adding this step to my nighttime skin care routine",2
"Wanted to love this, but it made me break out. The first few days I used it i could tell a difference in my skin. It felt smoother and plumper even, but after a week I started to break out a lot. The worst acne I’ve had in 5 years all over my chin.",0
"This serum is decadently moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling cared for. The plumping and overall long-lasting collagen nutrients are an incredible way to take care of your skin and this product truly feels luxurious to use. I am not a fan of the price of this product,  I think it’s very overpriced, but to be fair this productively much meets the quality that you’d expect at this price point. If you have the money, it’s worth it. Otherwise there are options almost as good for much less. This product was gifted by Algenist.",2
"I received the Daily Greens oil-free gel moisturizer complimentary from Farmacy! I was a huge fan of their cleansing balm so I was super excited to try this and it lived up to expectations! I found the consistency to be light enough that you could wear it morning or night, but it still locked in moisture. I also enjoyed the flaming scent, would definitely recommend!",2
"Awesome smoothing and moisturizing texture, good for the price because it will last you a long time. I have bought this in the past and it consistently works well. Will definitely smooth out any cracks on your lips. I usually apply this almost as a lip primer, and wait a couple minutes before applying any other lip products- works great!HOWEVER, I recently purchased this and it had a very disturbing, unclean, and very pungent smell. Perhaps the product I bought was old and was not properly stocked. Not quite sure what the issue is, but make sure you smell it before you buy!!!!Otherwise, would have given it 4.5 stars",1
"This product works great. It’s the only blemish lotion that gets rid of my breakouts overnight, I love it.",2
"I have huge pores, dark spots and occasional acne on my chin area, not anymore thanks to these pads! these pads are LIFE SAVING. i can’t stress it enough that they changed my skin completely. People compliment that I’m glowing and how young i look. if you are on the fence about these GET THEM! you won’t regret it.",2
This serum honestly is amazing. I use this at night before applying my mostrizuer and I wake up with my skin feeling really soft & bright. I’ve been using this product for over a year now & it’s one of my go to skincare products. LOVE!,2
Absolutely the best thing that ever happened! I’m in my 50s I hate make and foundation. I also get acne cysts from almost all products. Not this! I mix it with protini moisturizer every single day. Unbelievable!!!!,2
"I received this product as a free sample and it’s been two weeks and I love it. I’ve been looking for a step 1 to a double cleansing routine and I think I found a winner. The scent is great, it melts away makeup, and the after rinse feel was better than expected. Not at all oily!",2
"This is very similar to the lip sleeping mask but in a more sanitary “day time” applicator! I hesitated buying it for awhile because a good amount of reviews said it was nothing like the sleeping mask, etc. Not true at all! It’s slightly thicker & glossier, which I love! And lasts longer than most lip balms of this type. Smells exactly like the mask. I am definitely going to order more colors. Highly recommend!",2
Received this complimentary from Influenster in my Voxbox and I’ve been using it daily and I love it! I have VERY dry skin and it can be quite sensitive but this doesn’t bother it one bit! It dries down very quickly and doesn’t feel sticky. Would purchase!,2
"It’s convenient because it’s a stick and has 0 white cast but I only use it on my neck now because it broke me out and it’s incredibly sticky and greasy and not in a moisturizing way. Your hair will stick on this with any breeze and be careful around the eyes if you have sensitive eyes, they’re really irritating. Also there’s a fragrance, it’s nice and mild but definitely there.",0
I received this to try for my honest opinion from influenster. I’ve been usimg it for about 30 days and I’ve definitely seen a noticeable difference in my fine lines. It goes on pretty thick and comes with a little scoop (that I think makes me use to much) but it soaks in by the morning. It smells amazing. Definitely will be buying more when I run out.,2
I got recommendations so I bought this overpriced cream. Lid got stuck in the first month and it can’t be used. Didn’t do miracles before.,0
"I love this lip balm, I have the original too... somewhere... The only issue i have with this, is that it can be hard to open at first.",1
Holy smokes does this do the absolute opposite of what it promises. Zero stars.,0
"I’m not sure if its making a difference, but my under eyes look smooth and bright some days.",2
"Youth To The People, I’m in love. This cleanser is EXCELLENT. This makes my skin feel crazy fresh and so cleansed. This is such a gentle but powerful cleanser that detoxifies my skin without challenging my moisture barrier. I feel so confident that my acne is being kept away!!This really made my skin feel excellent and ready to absorb the other products in my skincare routine. I can’t believe I ever went without this cleanser. This is my new go to and I’m so happy to have found it!",2
"Thank you Sunday Riley for putting this trial duo together! I’ve used lactic acid in the past only to get very dry and scaly patches on my face. Haven’t had that experience with Good Genes and have noticed that my skin tone is much more even, my skin feels firmer, and the fine lines around my eyes are filling in! Luna is a wonderful oil!! The blue tansy they use really calms my skin and again with the combination of Good Genes even the crepe paper skin on my neck (I’m the big 5-0) is getting thicker and firmer. With this duo I also purchased Sunday Riley’s Bionic moisturizer. I have 2 age spots on my face that I use as a gauge as to how well products work, and I’m a very harsh critic. But yes...after 2 weeks of continual use they are getting lighter!",2
"I am really enjoying this product! I’ve always wanted to use essence, but hadn’t had a chance to pick one out. I was happy when Influenster sent this product to me. Overall, I’m happy with this product. It’s nice and light, and makes my face feel nice and hydrated. I also like that it doesn’t make my face feel sticky and that my skin soaks up the essence. It mixes well with my serum and moisturizer which is a big plus. I can’t wait to see if there are any skin improvements after using this for a longer period of time.",2
"Its a strong toner, gives a slight tingling sensation. I had bad acne marks and darks spots worked like a charm and cleared up my face.",1
NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN there is a mild version for that. This is the ONLY product that helps my acne if I use it regularly. Cut the pads in half so they last longer! Well worth it. If I use once a day I am acne free which is literally a miracle. Peter Thomas Roth is a the patron saint of my vanity. Forever and ever amen.,2
"I bought this because of the clean stamp of approval, and its glowing reviews and it did not disappoint.  It’s thick, hydrating and just so nice to wear. Will definitely buy again.",2
I use this under my makeup and it really allows for a smooth application.  It makes my skin silky smooth.,2
"I couldn’t love this essence more! It has the two best ingredients for my skin: lactic acid and yeast ferment. These two work together to make my skin smooth and even. I suffer from some redness and sun spots, and the improvement in the redness was immediately noticeable. I am hoping the sun spots will fade more with time.",2
I love love love love triple to infinity love this product. At first I was skeptical but it leaves my lips feeling so hydrated I’m at the end of mine and I’m so ready for a new one. Plus I love peach. I highly recommend this for hydration,2
The best moisturizer hands down! Its perfectly creamy and hydrating and doesn’t make me feel greasy. Love the texture of it and it smells amazing too. Product was kindly gifted but opinions are entirely my own.,2
"Sorry, but I didn’t see any change in my face after a time using it as other vitamin c products. Maybe just hydrate, but it is too sticky and it  never gets absorbed by the night. The smell is good.",1
"I received a sample of this product a while ago and decided to test it out recently. I unfortunately only read the reviews after I used it twice... And like a lot of reviewers, I also had major breakouts. My skin doesn’t break out easily, I do test out a lot of samples but this product really wrecked havoc. It’s definitively not for me, I don’t recommend it for anyone with the same skin type.",1
I have used the vitamin enriched lotion a lot especially without makeup but I do love it as a base before I add any makeup. My skin looks glowy and my foundation does stay fresh longer. I love that it does not give me acne.,2
My skin has been really dry and flaky this year. Tried some other C+E oil but nothing worked. Until I decided to give this one a try. Noticed an immediate difference. Woke up without all that flaky skin for the first time in a long time!,1
"This is my first time using any type of serum, before I bought this my skin care routine only consisted of Cetaphil face wash and aveeno lotion. I had small skin coloured bumps on my face for such a long time that I couldn’t get rid of & I also have big pores in my T zone area. THIS IS A GAME CHANGER. after using this in the morning after washing my face for only 4 days I have seen a noticeable difference in the size of my pores! The texture of my skin is much more even now too.",2
Very good product for the price.,2
"I got this for free and to be honest, I think it works best if you mix it would a little bit of oil because as soon as I started doing that, I noticed my skin looked even glowier and my pores looked so small! There’s no fragrance and I honestly prefer this way more than their other moisturizer with the mint green top",1
"At first I was skeptical about buying this because it is literally grape water in a can. I don’t believe in the results advertised by face mists because I believe they only hydrate your skin temporary and it’s a never-ending cycle to reapply throughout the day.It all started when I was at Sephora and a beauty advisor used this product on me because I had issues with fine lines forming from my foundation and I had an oily t-zone. She explained it might be a dry skin problem and she recommended me a new routine which included the grape water. It worked and my makeup survived for 16 hours that day. I didn’t know which product made the significant difference and I didn’t want to buy everything because it was not worth breaking my wallet for. Therefore, I bought the Becca ever-matte poreless priming perfector first to save my t-zone but after a week’s use I find it too drying on the sides of my nose and that’s when I tried the grape water. Now I use it as a setting mist after applying NARS light reflecting pressed setting powder and it keeps my face hydrated and shine-free throughout the day!",1
I absolutely love this serum. This was my first time to use an AHA every night. I can see a difference and recommend this product. The appearance of my skin overall looks healthier.,2
In love very mmoisturizing,2
This is the only eye cream that I can use due to he fact that I have extremely oily eyelids. It is hydrating and light-weight that it doesn’t leave my eyelids more oily than usual. I haven’t noticed any difference in eye puffiness.,1
"This serum goes on very well and sinks in quickly, but I didn’t notice any real difference besides more hydrated skin. However, I have sensitive skin and it also didn’t break me out or casue irritation.",1
I had a Deluxe sample of this and instantly loved it. First time I used it it left my skin glowing.  I noticed within a week my skin felt tighter (in a good way)  and the glow is amazing! Love the smell and consistency of the product. Will be purchasing full bottle.,2
"My skin is naturally very oily and prone to cystic breakouts. When I saw I would be receiving a face cream I was hesitant at first due to the oily nature of my skin but excited and intrigued by the idea of a pore clearing moisturizer. First off I was so surprise and I am now in love with the formula of this moisturizer. It’s lightweight. almost whipped texture, doesn’t feel heavy on my skin and doesn’t create any excess oil. It absorbs relatively fast once you massage it in and doesn’t dry tacky at all. After using this product twice a day for about a month I can say with confidence that it has made a difference for my skin. My breakouts have lessened and I haven’t had a cystic break out since I started using the product. It keeps smaller breakouts at bay and under control - This is definitely a product that I would recommend to anyone with ANY skin type and definitely a product I will be re-purchasing once I run out. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",2
YES YES YES!  This moisturizer is amazing. I use it after the shower and it keeps my face hydrated throughout the day.,1
It is great for my sensitive skin,2
I only used this gel creme for 5 days now and Iam already loving it. I used it right after I washed my face and used the tonique confort toner. It makes my feel so smooth already. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from influenster and Would definitely recommend.,2
Made my skin incredibly oily. The price is so high for such low quality. If you have oily or combination skin it will make it 10x worse. Had to wipe it off during work,0
I received this from influenster for testing purposes. I love this serum and i mix it with c farma for my morning skincare. It is very hydrating and makes my skin glow. You can skip moisturizer if you are using this serum. Love,2
"I’m glad Tatcha offered a mini size of this product for me to try out.  It definitely does give you a dewy skin look, but it didn’t provide the hydration that I was looking for, which was very disappointing.  I have used it before and after makeup and it didn’t really soothe my skin, so I will not be re-purchasing this product.",0
"Such an amazing exfoliator! It cleansed my skin without making it a really dry or being too harsh on the skin, which tends to be my issue with exfoliators. This is also great for taking off my make up.",2
"I like it but I wouldn’t say I’m super impressed.  I do enjoy the cool calming effect when I have a rosacea flare-up, but other than that, it doesn’t do much else. I will keep using for the flare ups but I need more from a moisturizer.",1
"Truly an amazing product. Does everything Josie Maran claims it does and more. I have noticed such a difference in my skin that I’m definitely a believer now. One of the changes that surprised me the most, is the way it has completely controlled the oil on my T-zone. Go figure, an oil that combats oily skin. There is also a noticeable change in the smoothness of my skin. I am a long time user of Philosophy’s “When Hope is not Enough“ serum and I have seen better results with Josie’s Argan oil in a very short period of time.",2
"My skin starts peeling once fall comes around and this face wash is great at stopping my shedding like a snake. My oily T-zone is also more under control lately. I’m not a big fan of the mint scent but it doesn’t linger.There’s definitely a frothiness to the wash, but it doesn’t foam like a soap. It reminds me of milk.In terms of skin reactions, I’ve had a few instances of bumps on my cheeks after cleansing. They went away in a few minutes and only happened when I cleanse with this after the gym. Maybe sweat + face wash = bumps?I like this face wash and I think it’s great for non-sensitive skin types, but I’m going to keep looking for my HG.",1
Just an over expensive face wash. Does not remove ANY waterproof makeup and seriously irritated my skin (which I sensitive so this wasn’t very shocking). Considering it couldn’t even remove my B.B. cream I’m not sure if it’ll even wash the daily dirt and oils from your skin very well. Smells nice though,0
"This product has been great when I need a heavy duty cream to get rid of any dry patches. When you put this on you can feel it on the skin but it definitely did not feel bad or too thick on the skin. Really appreciate the lack of fragrances in this product as well, not sure I would repurchase mainly based on the price tag!",1
Received this product from Influenster complimentary for testing purposes. I really have enjoyed using it. It is very hydrating and makes my skin feel nice. Not seeing a lot of difference in my skin and have used almost the whole bottle. Did not irritate my skin and I have oily acne prone skin. Did not make me break out. Don’t notice any scent which I do like having sensitive skin. Prob wouldn’t purchase myself but I do enjoy using it and will continue to use it until it is gone.,1
This is EVERYTHING. I’ve been looking for a eye cream for a long time and I think god heard me. I received this product as a gift from Influenster’s and I’m in love. Is light and it blends with ur sling right always so u don’t feel anything on.,2
"Absolutely in love with this product! My pores are practically erased and leaves my skin glowing. Never had so many compliments in my life. It stings a little so I only use it once a day max. I tend to use this at night because it leaves my skin a little sticky but if that doesn’t bother you, anytime is fine!",2
"Light as air, pleasant but not overwhelming scent, super hydrating! I woke up with radiant skin. No results on the youth preserve bit yet but I haven’t had it long— I’ll come back and amend this review once I’ve had the product longer!",2
"I have been using this moisturizer for over a year and it is my absolute favorite that I’ve used (I also tried Belif’s aqua bomb, but I like this one much more). It is thick but not heavy, and it is extremely long lasting throughout the day. Good for daytime under make up (helps makeup go on very smoothly) or for nighttime moisturizing. One container also lasts a long while (a little goes a long way), I think I’ve gone through 4 over the course of the year. Initially I thought it was a little expensive, but since it lasts a long time and it is very effective, I will continue to repurchase.",2
"I used the product as directed by warming up with my fingers and it was still difficult to apply. I used it after moisturizing but after applying, it showed every dry spot on my face especially the crevice of my nostrils, I did not like the finish and although it helped reduce the redness appearance, it definitely did not neutralize my face enough for me to wear this product alone. In addition, after a few hours (2-3) my face would look greasy, used it 3 times to give it a fair try and will be returning",1
I have oily/combo skin. Every time I have tried this I’m greasy within an hr.,0
This is really helping my skin texture issues. My skin is brighter and more smooth.  After I use this I follow up with The Ordinary’s hyaluronic acid syrup then their anti aging buffet serum! Wonderful combo! My skin is looking great!!!,2
I wasn’t absolutely sure this would work for me since I have oily skin as it is. But this product is ahhhmazing. It keeps my skin moisturized and I feel like my skin is producing a lot less oil then normal. Love love love it!!!!!!,1
"Gifted by Fresh. The Fresh sugar lip treatment is perfect for giving your lips a light tint! I tried the shade “peony” which is a rose-burgundy color (there doesn’t appear to be an option for that shade yet), but translates sheer on the lips. It has buildable pigment, and applies smoothly. Though it’s a bit expensive for a tinted lip balm, I really do like it!",1
"To start, I have clear normal sensitive skin.After hearing almost every YouTuber swear by this product, I rushed out to Sephora and bought it. I washed my face later that night and applied this moisturizer. Immediately something wasn’t right, it started to burn so badly. I waited about two minutes until I could no longer stand it and washed off the moisturizer. My skin was left red and flakey.I had this same burning issue with two other first aid beauty products too so it must be one of the ingredients that my sensitive skin does not like! I returned all three products. This just goes to show that you shouldn’t buy everything endorsed by a YouTuber!",0
"I absolutely LOVE using this water cream as a hydrating cream right before doing my makeup or even just when my face needs a fresh feel. As soon as you put this on you will feel a cooling sensation and what I love is how fast your skin absorbs it, and doesn’t leave your face looking “ugly shiny” or sticky/oily. My skins type is a combination of oily around nose area, but dry everywhere else and this product is just perfect. Also I love the soft smell of rose water which isn’t as heavy as other products I’ve used. I do realize not everyone might want to risk/be able to buy this at its price but let me just tell you, it is worth every penny.",2
"I’m loving this toner. My skin looks brighter and feels so hydrated, soft and has helped with some consistent blemishes. I honestly can’t notice the pore minimizing effect but I don’t have many noticeable enlarged pores so I can’t tell. I really like the texture and the scent is nice. I enjoy applying it, I have have combo skin and overall all, it works for me.",2
"I love this product. It improved the texture of my skin within just a few uses. I just bought a second bottle of this after finishing my first one. You only need to use it once a week, max twice a week. Make sure you do not keep it on for longer than 10 minutes. I have sensitive skin so I keep it on for 5.",2
"I will admit, I was a little nervous to try such a strong acid serum because in the past my skin has had strong “purging” reactions to acids. This stuff was such a surprise! The texture is very creamy and it has a light scent that I didn’t find off putting. It blends into the skin very easily and I felt it absorbed pretty quickly. My skin was immediately a little tacky but that lasted only a moment. After I applied this to my face, my skin felt very smooth to the touch. I am blessed with very clear skin but I did have a spot on my chin leftover from a recent breakout the first night I tried this product. I wont say it was gone the next morning, cause it wasn’t, but it had faded a good bit and was no longer as red and noticeable. My skin definitely still felt very smooth and soft and seemed to look a lot brighter overall the next morning. I started off just using this every other day, just to make sure my skin could handle it because it is 20% acid and that is very strong for me. I would definitely repurchase and recommend to anyone who wants their skin to feel very smooth and even and to fade dark spots.",2
You need extremely dry skin to use this product. I wish it would dry faster on the skin.,1
"Lovely fresh smell, very effective —it’s the hot cloth part of my cleansing routine that I rely on, but this made it special",1
I bought these when I ran out of Peter Thomas Roth’s Unwrinkle Pads. I think they work just as well and they cost quite a bit less. I will buy them again.,1
I have bought so many moisterizers and none of them worked for my dry skin. this one is incredible. Put it on at night and let it sink in while you sleep and wake up with super soft and moisturized skin.,2
"Love this product! The gel texture is so smooth and lightweight, yet so moisturizing. Very slight fragrance, which I love, but disappears quickly.",2
Perfect for sensible skin (   T zone oily) love it!,2
I am OBSESSED with these! I grew up using Biore strips and thought this was going to be the same thing but they are so much better! My pores were significantly smaller and I had less oil on my nose. I would recommend these to everyone!,2
"It’s AMAZING! I use it as my nighttime moisturizer and day, as an eye cream, and hand cream! I also love that it is clean! ❤️❤️❤️❤️",2
This is my all time favorite lips moisturizer. I have used so many different products and nothing rehydrates my lips quite like this!,2
"Love 💕 love ❤️ love 💗 love 💗 great for hydration.,   For people who love make up 🆙 or not this is the power",2
Love the product so far. My skin does feel soft and supple. I use before putting the Tatcha Vitamin C serum and do feel a difference in my skin. It feels moisturized and soft. The product is a little expensive but very small quantity is required every day so the bottle will last long.,2
Takes all your makeup off without overdrying or stinging and a little goes a long way - perfect!,2
"This moisturizer is lovely! It’s so velvety and luxurious, and leaves my skin feeling very supple. I’ve been on the lookout for a new moisturizer and I finally found one that I like! I received this from #influenster to try, I’ve been using it for a week already, and will definitely be buying my own when I run out!",2
Hmm I really wanted to love this product. But it broke me out I used the whole sample to fully give this product a try but I didn’t notice a difference.,0
This rosebud salve in a tube is a great lip moisturizer for bedtime and throughout the day. It’s not greasy and doesn’t have a bad taste like some salves.,1
"I got a sample of this from my local Sephora because I read the good reviews and it intrigued me. I had a little bit of congested pores around my mouth and I had a big under-the-skin pimple. It was red and a big lump. That night, I washed my face as I usually do with my Clarisonic, dried my face off and applied the mask. Even though the mask is blue, it applies sheer. I left it on for 25 mins and it dried down. I washed it off and followed up with my regular night time skin care routine. Let me tell you... a good night’s sleep later, I wake up in the morning and the congestion is GONE. Not only is the congestion gone but the pimple on my chin SHRUNK and BECAME FLAT and was NO LONGER RED. I will say though that it doesn’t shrink your pores as much as a deep cleansing clay mask would. But it never claimed to. I know this mask is expensive but I definitely think it’s worked it! I will buy the full size in a few days!",2
I love the smell of this and it is so silky-creamy going on.,1
I love using this product. The slight colour is perfect and the applicator is amazing. It leaves the same glossy finish as the Laneige Lip Mask but slightly less sticky.,1
I have acne prone combination skin which means I go from parched skin to an oil field in a few hours. This moisturizer keeps my skin from going oily. I use this under make-up and the foundation goes on so beautifully. I’m not going to experiment with other moisturizers any more. This is my constant.,2
"I’m in my 20’s and I have VERY blemish-prone combo skin. I also tend to pop my pimples (even though I know I shouldn’t) so my skin has some scarring. Most days, I used to use the Dr. Jart BB cream because it gives me a decent amount of coverage without looking like I have too much makeup on. Also, foundation breaks my skin out worse. But this stuff... SERIOUSLY AMAZING. It makes my skin look naturally glowy, smooth and d**m near flawless. Don’t get me wrong, it doesn’t cover up the blemishes totally but it does cover up the scarring and other imperfections. It also looks very natural... even more so than the BB cream. My skin no longer gets so oily and I think it helps my BB cream to stick a lot better too! It is a bit thick to spread on, but the results are so worth it.BUY IT NOW!",2
"Would definitely buy it again, this product helped a lot with my redness especially during the summer. I have combination skin and this product was perfect for me. You won’t even need foundation after using it.",2
"makes my lips so soft, I have the grapefruit one and it smells great,  nothing over powering, also so worth the price, a little goes along way!",2
"I got this and was excited to try it, but the price almost had me on the floor. Yes, it’s Tatcha and yes it works well, but $65 for a mini?? That’s just way too high. Luckily a little goes a long way, so I’ll have it for a while. But I definitely will not be purchasing again.",1
"I had to try this since the price was reasonable and it seems many celebrities use it. It smells great, but is not as hydrating as chapstick.",1
Absolutely love this product! Extremely hydrating and makes your skin/lips feel so smooth and soft. It is easily absorbed but no need to re-apply constantly.  Love the container that it comes in - cute and compact. Will definitely be a repeat user!,2
"I received this product free from an Influenster VoxBox and wanted to give it a month for my honest opinion. I have fairly sensitive skin and while it does smell great, it stings my face when I use it, which is why it hasn’t become part of my routine. I don’t know why it stings my face but I am not enthusiastic about using it because of that.",0
"This stuff smells great, removed make up really well, and leaves my skin feeling super soft. A little goes a long way so this should last awhile!",2
I am a huge fan of fresh products and can always count on their new lines to help perfect my skin. This cream has been amazing for smoothing and moisturizing my skin and I can’t wait to see the difference it makes in a month. This was gifted by fresh,2
"See title. I can’t say how it worked because I couldn’t get past the very strong smell. I’m glad I got a sample before I bought this, I will not buy this but I love good genes and other SR products.",0
Illumining! This cream within a few days of usage just brightened my appearance. I noticed a glow that I hadn’t had before.  If you aren’t used to anything with a plumping feeling then this may feel a little surprising to you.  The end result was well worth it.  A lot of product goes a long ways so no need to use a ton.  That alone makes it worth the price.,2
"My eyes get a red rash sometimes in the winter from being so dry. Most eye creams sting because they have harsh ingredients.  This Kiehl’s creamy eye treatment was everything I was wishing for!!  It goes on soft and blends in so nicely!  It is a cute green color, with no strong smell.  It doesn’t sting, which tells me that it is very very gentle and contains more natural ingredients.  I am so impressed.  Kiehl’s from now on for me!!",2
"I had HORRIBLE hormonal acne all over my chin that WOULDNT GO AWAY. One would disappear and 3 more would come up. This product is AMAZINGGGGG. I immediately noticed results, my acne has not only cleared up but its also helping with my red spots. This mask is worth every penny. I have tried EVERYTHING.This is the ONLY mask that helped my terrible acne .",2
"I received my #freeproduct sample of Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream though #topboxcircle. This moisturizer goes a long way, especially when coupled with the eye cream and serum!  This product was lightweight and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized throughout the day. I haven’t used Clinique products since I was a young adult, but I would definitely add this line back to my regime.",2
Tried this for two weeks and I’m already more confident to go make up free.  I have combo skin and I didn’t find this too heavy or oily.  Just rich and moisturizing.  Would recommend it for sure! This evened my skin tone and left my skin feeling refreshed and perky.,2
such an amazing moisturizer. i did get it for free to review but wow. this is really good. i stay moisturized for 24 hours with this bad boy!! would buy again.,2
"I’m very iffy on this product. I like how it makes my skin feel day to day, but I don’t notice any significant changes in the appearance of my skin over time. Also, I seem to be going through the product extremely fast. I bought it less than month ago and less than half the bottle is left. It’s like it’s disappearing because I’ve been using the recommended 1-2 pumps per day. I most likely will not repurchase, at least for a while.",1
Super lightweight and feels great! I have sensitive skin and normal to dry skin so this is great during the day! I felt that it can’t really stand alone as the solo moisturizer so I pair it with the hydration serum.,1
"I really love this product! The only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the smell. The smell isn’t terrible it’s just not watermelon. I would say more of a grass-cucumber scent. However, I saw previous reviews say the smell lasts all day & your face smells terrible which is false. I also saw other reviews say this leaves your skin sticky and dry which was also not my experience! After using this my skin feels hydrated, glowy, and I notice a huge decrease in my pores. I would definitely recommend/purchase again.",1
I love this cleanser! I have super oily skin & this really helps with the oil control. It isn’t over-drying or harsh. I use mine with my Clarisonic & it works great!,2
"I usually don’t use products like this, but I liked it. It left my face feeling smooth and it had a good scent. I would recommend this product. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.",1
"Absolutely Gorgeous packaging - and I WANTED TO LOVE IT! it’s thick, soothing, and I felt like I was putting butter on my face (in the best way possible). No scent and based on great reviews I wanted to try it so badly because it seems to work miracles. BUT...I broke out so bad shortly after putting it on. I had sparse, painful pimples and this was the only new product I introduced into my routine. So sadly, I must return it.",0
I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary Estee Lauder Revitalizing Supreme cream through Influenster . When I first opened the cream I thought the cream would go on light because the cream doesn’t look heavy. I was pleasantly  surprised at the velvety feel of the cream. A little goes along way ! A few dabs is all you need . I noticed that my skin looked fresher and well hydrated after using it.,2
"Love the feel of this cream but after using it for a week, I am broken out all over my face in cystic type acne. This has not happened to me in well over 20 years. Returning.",0
"A great moisturizer for the winter/colder days! Swapping this out for the summer, but I’ll definitely go back to this in the winter since it’s super thick and moisturizing.",2
"It goes on really silky. Love that it doesn’t feel oily at all, didn’t have any skin breakouts or irritation from it. Really put it to the test with a  week in the sun in Hawaii. No burn at all. Would definitely recommend!",2
"I received this serum to test out, but just got a sample size. Unfortunately since I didn’t receive a full size, I couldn’t make a judgment about what it did for my skin texture or how it works on wrinkles. I love that it isn’t sticky and that it goes on so smoothly, though!",1
"I love this, I mix it with my CC cream and it makes my skin smell like oranges, along with making it start to look like sun-kissed California skin.",2
"This is by far my favorite moisturizer! Perfect for my skin type! Also great for acne prone skin. A little bit goes a long way, so it’s a really great value in my opinion, too.",2
"I can’t use most toners because they irritate my extremely sensitive skin and cause tiny red bumps to appear that won’t go away no matter what I do. This toner is really impressing me. I thought I’d give it a try since I read it can be good for sensitive skin, and I am really loving it. It doesn’t sting after applying, has not caused me any irritation at all (which is basically a miracle because my skin hates just about everything), and I am pleased so far with the performance. I haven’t seen a shift in the size of the pores yet but am hopeful for that with a longer period of use. It’s a winner for me and I will definitely purchase the full size product after buying the mini to start.",2
"I’m giving it three stars because I want to love this and know it works beyond how my skin is reacting...I got a trial size of this and fell in love with it in every way and was 100% ready to spend the full price for the full size...two days later I broke out so bad, and almost in a cystic acne way. Not fun. I figured maybe it was something else? I’ve used it a few times incorporating it in different ways and with different products and every single time, the next morning my skin is so plump, glowy, smooth and healthy looking - aaand than I break out terribly again. I wanted this to work so bad and have tried to make it work, and it just does not match my skin type at all :( Maybe better for a drier skin type as mine is relatively normal, and may have just been too much for its comfort zone? I WOULD recommend trying it though because I firmly believe it IS a great product but just not for me.",1
I love this product! Just ordered for the second time because I can’t get enough of it. Great for applying at night!,2
This has got to be the best thing I have ever used to get off my makeup. It takes off EVERYTHING and you don’t need a lot of product. I don’t mind the raccoon look from the mascara & eyeliner. Honestly 100/10 and I will never use anything else.,2
"Great product for redness prone skin. Love that there’s SPF too, it’s been my go-to day time moisturizer for the last 2 years",2
"I know people primarily like using this as a lip balm, and I did too until a week ago. My elbows recently broke out into one of my usual eczema cycles, and nothing I put on my elbows was helping to ease the itching/scabbing process. I absentmindedly applied the Rosebud Salve to the eczema-areas, and it helped protect the scabs while I showered in very hard/minerally water. I also noticed the itching from the eczema was absent (usually they itch like MAD after a hot shower). I shrugged and kept applying it to my eczema cause I’m trying to stay away from steroid creams.1 week later, MY ELBOWS ARE ALMOST ECZEMA FREE. Usually my eczema’d elbows last for few months at a time but it’s gone within 2 weeks. *weeps from happiness*Anyway. So. Long story short: not only good for lip balm. Also good for eczema.",2
"This feels like a dream on your face! The texture is magic! Just upon placing a bit of product on your face you know it’s good! I’ve never felt this texture before! It’s rich and creamy, kinda thick but in a good way! It feels so smooth like a veil. I am so in love with how this feels! I woke up with super soft moisturized skin. Can’t stop touching my face!",2
"I was so excited to try the famed SK-II Pitera essence! It absorbed quickly and left my skin hydrated but not sticky. After using this for a few days, my skin was so much softer. The difference after using it for a month is tremendous. My skin is softer, brighter, and less red. It’s definitely on the expensive side, but if you can afford it, it’s great.",2
"Absolutely in loveeee. Just got it in the mail and I’m already ready to buy a few more. So comfortable, not sticky & hydrating",2
received this product complimentary from influencer. I really liked this product. It’s lightweight for use under makeup or a no makeup day. I like using it at nighttime before bed. I would purchase,2
I have used a few high end microexfoliating face washes and this is by far my favorite. I am not completely sure if this exfoliates better but something in the formula makes your face feel buttery smooth. Mild smell and feels like an other scrub. I received this free in a good voxbox from influenster.,2
This serum is amazing! As soon as you put it on you notice your skin begin to glow. Works great under makeup as well. Minimizes pores/dark spots and smells amazing. Will definitely keep using. (Received this product complimentary for testing).,2
This lip balm smells great and is moisturizing BUT it evetually is drying to lips. The more you use it overnight as a lip mask it dries out your lips. I will not be repurchasing this. Nivea does a better job with their hydrating lip balms for $3. SMH @ LANEIGE for $20 it should be plumping and hydrating our lips  better than anything out there!,1
"I was really excited to try this moisturizer because I have a lot of sebum bumps and the only thing that helps keep it at bay is retinol or salicylic acid pads. The first thing I noticed is that it smells like toned down salicylic acid. It feels minty and it absorbs easily and quickly. It does leave a slight shine but I don’t mind it. I don’t see immediate results like I would if I were to use a salicylic acid pad but I do like that since it’s a moisturizer, I don’t have to use a pad and moisturizer separately.",1
"My combo skin (w/ large pores in T zone, oily, and cystic acne) is very temperamental. I get dry flaking on the outside of my cheeks, white heads with any moisturizer that my skin hates, and sloughing skin on my nose if my routine becomes too aggressive. I’ve been using this moisturizer mostly only as a day moisturizer, but a few times as both day & night, and my skin feels more balanced with it on. The thin skin on my nose feels intact, my t zone feels moisturized but not oily, and I don’t get the random white heads that I normally do. I’ve tried this moisturizer in both dry and humid climates this summer, and it works well in both. I’ve tried the B serum, and it was lacking a bit in day hydration. This moisturizer reminds me of the water cream for tatcha, in the level of hydration, but the ingredients seem to do a much better job of keeping my skin balanced. I also like combining 2 pumps with the d bronze, for a glowing no-makeup day. The packaging is very sterile, and easy to use.",2
"Honestly, I’ve been using it for a month and it hasn’t really changed my skin yet. In the beginning, I used it night and day, on a dry face, but when I saw no change I asked around and learned that I should apply it on a damp face to activate it. Hyaluronic acid absorbs moisture from its surroundings into the skin, so if you apply it on damp skin, it will absorb the water. After I started using it like this, and only using it in the morning, I saw a difference. My main concerns were my enlarged pores on my nose and some breakouts on the forehead, and my forehead cleared up a little. I used this product with the 10% niacinamide + 1% zinc syrum and I think they helped each other clear up my skin! I haven’t seen a difference in my pores, but I will be consistent with the product and hope it works its magic.",1
It’s a good refreshing mist with no irritants and it’s priced decently for the amount you get.,2
"Only acne clarifying product that has actually ever worked for me. I have dry skin and this doesn’t dry my skin out, it’s the ONLY thing that has gotten rid of my forehead texture!",2
Such an awesome face wash with my Clarisonic. It gets so frothy and luscious when using it. Doesn’t leave my skin feeling dried out or stripped,2
"Not sure if the formula has changed or my face must be really dry. I dont remember it drying up so quick when I apply it. well, I will give it time. My face still feels super dry, but it has only been a week.",1
"Felt good using it, but it dried my (normal to dry) skin out instantly -- felt like it had soap in it anyway. Wonderful smell. Used it as body wash after I decided I couldn’t use it for my face and it was really luxurious!",1
The name od the product is exactly how you feel afterwards... fresh. It smells like cucumbers and leaves your skin feeling clean.,2
"this is a lovely moisturizer, feels really moisturizing but gentle! however, it’s a little bit heavy for my oily skin and feels like it sits on top of the skin a bit",1
Keeps my lips moisturizer through the winter. It’s thick enough to stay on lips for most of the day.,2
I have used this stuff forever- great balm that makes your lips shiny with a nice light scent. I have used it for cracked knuckles or dry spots on my face. Its great to have on hand- only thing I don’t like is that you have to put your finger in it to use which grosses me out if my hands aren’t clean! I have also used the tube form which is just as awesome!,1
Works like a charm but the liquid dries up quickly. Have to rebuy often.,1
"I received a free sample size of the new formula for review from #influenster I started using it nightly as soon as I got it in the mail. It feels very nice on the skin, no distinct or unpleasant smell. After the first night I woke up with new new small pimples I thought it might be from my normal hormonal acne and/or maskne popping up again so I continued use, as the week went on my entire face broke out. Just to be clear I have oily/combination extremely acne prone skin. After a week I stopped using it and my skin cleared up gradually since. I just don’t think this product works for me but it may work well for other skin types.",0
I receive this product sample from topbox for free and i loved it! The quality of the product is really nice! The texture is rich but doesn’t make your concealer move. There is no smell wich i love especially for my eye contour,2
"The DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL is absolutely amazing. It leaves your skin feeling so clean and smooth. I only got a trial size, but it was enough to sell me. I’d be cautious if you have sensitive skin, but otherwise, you will see results.",2
The only kind of makeup remover people should be using is a cleansing balm. Throw those wipes away! This stuff is great for all skin types and very gentle. the texture is similar to cold pressed coconut oil. The balm is a solid that loosens and melts as you move it around your face. This container will last you 6+ months if you really work the balm into your skin—a little goes a long way.,2
Love this product so much!! Works so well for me!! Worth the price because they are simple and they work i recommend for everyone that has acne because its iso good.,2
"This scrub is AMAZING. I am a nurse and I am having to wear a face mask everyday. The face mask breaks me out in bumps every time. I come home and use this and it clears up my skin and makes it feel so soft. This stuff is the best, you won’t regret buying it!",2
"I got this as a sample as I was sure how it would be for my very sensitive skin. it was super gentle, made my skin really soft and moisturized, as my other face scrub kinda makes my skin feel dry. I gave it 4 stars only because I find you have to use more product compared to my scrub",1
"Okay so I’ve been wanting to try this product in my AM routine, as I have very sensitive, fair skin with rosacea. I was nervous because many products irritate my skin further, causing redness, stinging, the hot flush, all of that. This product exceeded my expectations- I put some product in my hands, warmed it up, and then quickly applied to my face. The color blended in very well and it reads like a lightweight foundation, in my opinion. No irritation felt at all. This will be great for me to wear to the office- I want to save it for days when I want a slightly more “covered-up“ look. No harsh white cast from the zinc either. I will say, be careful to adequately moisturize before applying. I have dry-combo skin, and I find the product blends in best with the oilier parts of my skin (my t-zone)- it is a bit drying for the drier parts of my skin. If you struggle with redness/rosacea like I do, I’d highly recommend you give this product a shot.",2
Its okay ig I hate the texture and the color washes you out atleast it did to me but other than that its a decent sunscreen and covering redness,1
In love with this new serum! Glow Recipe products don’t always agree with my skin and I’m so happy that this was a winner. The packaging is beautiful and has so many amazing barrier replenishing ingredients. I didn’t notice much improvement with redness but it’s very soothing and hydrating. The texture is light and it sinks in so easily. It leaves such a nice glow and makes my skin feel comfortable again especially in the mornings when I wake up tight and dry.,1
I received Clinique smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye cream free from Topbox. Though it’s a small sample but it lasted 4 days and the area around eyes felt smooth with the application. It did not feel heavy after applying. Thanks.,2
"Love this for makeup removal once my skin starts getting dry due to colder weather. If you have dry skin, this is for you!",2
Not orange at all. Doesn’t oxidize. Stays put all day.,2
I love this moisturizer so much it feels so soft and good on my skin! It is very helpful for dry skin and it makes my skin feel so smooth.,2
Does a great job of preventing and softening lines around the eyes.,2
"Loved other Tatcha products for their exfoliation, however this cleanser fell flat. The ’beads’ are very gentle and felt like a good cleanser, but did not feel like the best “deep cleanse“ as I was hoping for. Definitely returning.",0
I used the peels faithfully for thirty days along with the Dr Dennis hyaluronic marine moisturizer and a vitamins serum. I used the moisturizer and serum twice a day and the peel once per day. One would think that with such expensive products you will see some form of improvement or a title glimmer of hope to purchase a second batch. I will not reorder as at this point it’s hopeless and to waste over three hundred dollars on products that don’t work it’s just a waste of money. Maybe it worked for others but not for me. Waste of time and money !,0
"I had high hopes for this product but I was completely disappointed. It didn’t really keep my lip moisturized for long and it also dried out my lip to the point where my lips even got darker. I was surprised because of all of the good reviews but this product did not work at all for me, I ended up returning it.",0
Omg! This product is amazing when I first saw it on beauty gurus pages I was like mmmmmmm does it work I tried it and what would usually take me about 7 makeup wipes took me one dip into the balm. One thing that I was scared about was it would make my skin oily well it didn’t just trust me you won’t regret this no more morning after raccoon eyes.,2
I am excited to add another Shiseido product to my repertoire! Their product is consistently high quality with great packaging as well. This sunscreen is amazing for my sensitive skin and the new heat and wet technology is awesome so you don’t have to worry about to many reapplications.,2
"Glow Recipe has quickly turned into one of my favorite brands. Their formulas just seem to work on my skin, and this moisturizer is no exception. Skin feels plum(p) and hydrated after each use, and my complexion looks healthier overall. Love the refillable packaging.",2
"I had never previously heard of this brand, or product, was was suggested it by a wonderful woman I met at a market research study. I grabbed a sample, used it once, and DAYS LATER my skin still looks incomparable to before I used it. I suffer from scarring and discoloration from acne, which causes me serious distress and frustration. No joke, I have only used this once so far, and my marks are faded enough that my confidence in public is up. I’ve only given 4 stars for now since I haven’t used it extensively, but I imagine after buying a full size, it’ll be 5 stars from me.",1
I got this as a sample using my sephora rewards points. I followed the instructions on how to use it. I left it on my face for about a min and washed it off. My face did feel clean but the next day I had white little bumps all over my face and my face felt like a sand paper. I regret using it. If you have a bit of sensitive combo skin I would not recommend it.,0
"This is a fragrance free lightweight moisturizer. It goes on smoothly and I love the applicator—you turn the top to reveal the pump! This provided me with some moisture but not enough for my skin in the winter since I get super dry. I can see this as being sufficient for the summer and fall time. However, I can’t justify paying this much when other moisturizers work just as well or better for me.",1
This product was gifted by glow recipe.Finally my face doesn’t feel like the dark side of the moon. Thanks Watermelon Glow PHA + BHA Pore tight toner I feel refreshed and my skin feels clean. I have an issue with my pores around my nose and high cheek area and it made an impact in reducing the size. What’s great is that the antioxidants from the PHA and BHA exfoliants give my skin a bright and healthy glow. The texture reminds me of gel candy but isn’t sticky. It’s more like a subtle gel that smells like a watermelon Jolly Rancher. My skin doesn’t break out a lot but it did reduce whatever attempts where starting to show. This toner isn’t as harsh as some of the other toners I have used and it seems to be a good fit for anyone to try. I recommend everyone giving it a try.,2
My number one issue with wearing makeup is taking it off at the end of the day. The new Belif makeup removing cleansing balm is a really unique product which makes that process so easy. I thought at first it was going to be your average oil-based makeup remover. At first application it does seem like that: you first take a dollop in your hands before applying to your face. It does a great job at removing your makeup. Washing it off is when it gets really interesting. When the balm mixes with water it foams up like a normal face wash. I had my everyday cleanser that I use since I thought I would need to use another product to wash the balm off but when it mixes with water the balm turns into a cleanser to make it easier to wash off your face while still leaving your skin feeling super smooth and moisturized.The balm itself is not scent free so if your skin doesn’t do well with scented products it may not be best for you to use. With that being said however the scent is very nice and fresh allowing your skin to relax at the end of the day.,2
"I’m obsessed with this cream. I feel like everything just works, the colour, the scent, the consistency. It feels luxurious yet still light and non greasy. A little goes a long way. And it sucks into the skin fast which I love! My skin is dewy and hydrated and plump but not greasy or shiny.",2
"I’ve tried so many glycolic aha and bha products to try and smooth my skin and keep the acne away, but they never seem to really do the job. This serum has been a dream come true. It’s so easy and effective. It’s easy to apply right before bed and it doesn’t feel sticky like I have something on my face. I wake up and my skin glows. I highly recommend this product. Also, in reading the other review right before mine, I have to comment that it has no scent whatsoever, so I’m not sure why they mention a ’citrus’ smell, there is nothing like that with this product and it’s not a cream at all, it’s a lightweight gel that soaks right in. I think she’s talking about a different product! LOL",2
This is really moisturizing but it feels like a film is left on the skin and its almost tacky/ sticky feeling I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,2
"first off i love the packaging, it’s super clean just like the actual face wash! i made the mistake the first time lol, but a little goes a long way! it has a clean scent! this face wash leaves my skin feeling refreshed & clean! i’ve already noticed some minor blemishes clearing up! i can’t wait to see continued results!",1
This facial treatment essence seems to work well. It does have a slight smell to it which I don’t really like. But it helps make me feel refreshed. It is a little pricey.,1
"The first time I used this I dabbed dots of it on my face and tried to spread it around. I find it really hard to work with that way. Instead, follow the directions and spread it between your hands first, then apply to the face. I really like it used that way on no-makeup-makeup days, but I do find that it doesn’t dry down at all and so if you’re looking for something transfer-proof this isn’t it. But for a little coverage in an all-in-one step, this is perfect.",2
I love how hydrated my skin feels when using this product. My skin gets dry during winter but will get oily if I used heavy moisturizers. I can use the drops under my normal/ daily moisturizer without any issues.,2
"I purchased this cream along with the other new Cicapair products when they first released, and shortly after also received this product complimentary for testing purposes. The Cicapair line is by far my favorite skincare line, both high end and drugstore, and this product did not disappoint! I have combination skin that is more on the drier side, especially living in the PNW, and this cream does wonders for my dryness! It also really helped with the irritation my skin was getting from living in an area where there were tons of wildfires and smoke this summer, I felt assured that my skin was nice and protected. I would definitely repurchase!",2
"Let me start off by saying that I’m currently on my 2nd bottle of this serum. I definitely saw a big improvement with my acne scars, I had a bit of discoloration from it and it’s improved soooo much! The texture of my skin feels so much smoother and my overall complexion looks healthier, which makes a great canvas to apply makeup on. When I first tried it I was a little surprised to see that the consistency of the serum was that of a lotion (not your traditional gel like serum) it has a nice faint smell to it (citrus) The directions say apply 1-2 pumps when applying but it dispenses a lot of product with just one pump. With that being said I find that I’m going through these bottles like water! I just got my 2nd one in mid February and I’m half way done with it, which wouldn’t bother me all that much of it wasn’t so expensive, but I’m seeing actual results so I will continue to purchase it. In my book it’s a splurge but a necessary splurge for sure.",1
"This is, by far, the best mask I have ever used. It is light weight, easy to apply, did not dry out my face and it absolutely made my pores look smaller. The smell is refreshing and not overpowering. I received mine as a sample, and I’ve already purchased this product. I used it on my freshly cleaned face and was expecting it to become dry and flake offset that was not the case. It was easy to apply and remove, clean up was a breeze! Do yourself a favor and buy this mask!",2
This powder cleanser is great! It’s easy to use and works well with my oily skin. After using I feel my skin is brighter and smoother. It also helps with my pores a bit. I use it daily in the evening and night. (Gifted by Dermalogica),2
I’m so glad I didn’t buy the full size! I wore it for one day with little time in full the sun and my face is covered in spots and freckles (not the cute kind). Its going to take months to get it back to normal. I saw another review mention this may be a problem with chemical products but I havent had this happen this drastically with another brand that I use,1
I recently received this serum complementary for testing purposes. I’ve been using this serum for about a week and I have to say that I can sincerely see a transformation on my skin. I feel like my enlarged pores have been reduced and my skin feels so rejuvenated since using this serum. I also have to mention that the scent of this serum is very pleasing and not overpowering at all. I have used products in the past that contain retinol to help with my fine lines but they always irritates my skin but this product does not irritate my skin at all.,2
I get the hype about this stuff ! I tried it years ago and was amazed since then I tried a bunch of other exfoliating facial products and seriously nothing compared ! Bonus points it doesn’t irritate my skin!! ( gifted by dermalogica sampling ),2
This is AMAZING. I use it once every week. I have combination skin and am prone to acne. It helps clear up my acne the next day after I use it. I really recommend it.,2
"I tried this based on recommendation. I like Laneige lip mask, but this mask is far less sticky, and more moisturizing. I decided to purchase this tinted version as a lipstick/gloss alternative for wearing at home. I have extremely dry lips, and this is coming in handy as Winter is approaching.",2
"My facial cleanser tends to dry me out and once in a while I have patchy skin. I put this on before I go to sleep and the next day my skin is good. No flakiness, no dryness. This product is amazing. It is a bit sticky but your skin will soak this up. I don’t mind stickiness as long as my face is moisturized. If you don’t want to take the plunge right away, get the smaller size or if you’re lucky, it could be in the point perks. Try it out, you won’t regret it!",2
"I’ve tried several sunscreens this year, including other Supergoop! Products and brands not sold in Sephora. I must say, this works best with my combination skin, even as I reapply on top of makeup throughout the day. As the name suggests, there really is no white cast or residue, even after reapplications. There is a scent that might bother some people, but it fades very quickly.",2
"Although I received this item from influenster complimentary for my honest review....It arrived to me in a damaged open tube. Of course, I would not risk putting exposed product on my face. I say next time have better quality control for packaging your formulas. If you would like to ship me a new undamaged complimentary product I will happily replace this review with a review on the actual formula that I can use.",0
"I am in love with the color and glow that this has given my skin! This sunscreen is on my top list for summer days because not only you are protected but you also have that sun tan look, perfect for very pale office skin like mine! If I can add a feedback is that the packaging doesn’t do justice to the quality of the product!",2
"I wanted to love this product, but I’ve been using it for nearly half a year like every night, and I’ve seen no improvement. I get a very dry nose area, and this didn’t help hydrate at all. Only bonus is I liked the way it smelt! Hard finding nice night creams that smell great. I sadly wouldn’t buy again :(",0
this is my new cream! I’ve never bought a moisturizer twice until now. my combination skin needs an oil free but very hydrating formula and it’s so hard to find something so perfect. I’ve used this during summer and winter and it works great during both times of year. a little goes a long way so the price is worth what you get. the cream feels heavy but after applying it absorbs really well into your skin. let it sit for about ten minutes before putting anything else on. I just wish it came in an airtight pump jar.,2
I just got my second bottle of this and it is the best cleanser for your money! It cleans everything off my face and my skin is left so soft at first I thought I didn’t wash off all the cleanser! Fyi I have oily skin and itit’s great for me!,2
"Love it. Smell’s good, my skin is soft after using it. I will buy it again.",2
"Absolutely love the texture of this vitamin enriched moisturizer - light yet moisturizing, it’s got a “whipped“ consistency. I like the fact that even though it’s vitamin enriched, it doesn’t have that stinky vitamin smell like some other products do. It’s lightly fragrant - natural and fruity.",2
"This stuff works great at minimizing redness! My only question is, should it be used before or after you moisturizer your face?If before, it tends to spread the cream over your face and loses it coverage. Other than that I’m impressed with the instant change in redness.",1
I received a deluxe sample of this product and I have been applying it to my crows feet area and between my brows and I can’t believe how youthful and vibrant my skin looks now! I want to buy the full size and start using it on my whole face. Highly recommend!,2
"I haven’t needed an acne spot treatment in forever until I started breaking out again. I’m 32 and I’m waiting for it to stop.This product is pretty effective. It dries out most zits in two to three days but it smells awful. If you don’t mind pink spots and the smell of sulfur then this product is for you. I’d give 5 stars if the product smelled nicer, but if that compromises its effectiveness then no thanks.",1
It is a very good face exfoliate. It makes my face amazing and refreshed. I don’t use it daily so my skin doesn’t get irritated. I use two times a week to deep clean my skin. I recommend!Gifted by dermalogica sampling,2
As a beauty bargainista the price on this was hard to swallow but I have seen a huge improvement in my skin since starting this in December. I use it about every other night. I was struggling with small bumps on my forehead and nothing else would get rid of them. Since using this the bumps have diminished drastically. I’m going to try to keep picking up back ups of this when Sephora has a sale. After much thought I decided to purchase this over the Sunday Riley good genes treatment. I read on beautypedia that this has better ingredients.,2
I paid the oil with my moisturizer for a very dewy glow. It helps with dryness and have been using it for about a year and can tell a noticeable difference in my skin.,2
This serum has helped with my skin. I use this daily and my pores are smaller. I like the scent of this product and I like that it is lightweight. #Freeproduct,2
"Before the purchasing the cleansing balm, I would rub my face with make-up remover wipes and still find make-up residue, especially mascara. This balm is a game changer and has completely transformed the way I look at make-up removers.",2
"It takes your face makeup off as well as a makeup wipe would (where you still have to go in with a second cleanser or remover to take everything off). However, it doesn’t take EVERYTHING off in one use and I find myself having to use a lot of it at at time. I would only recommend this to someone with extremely sensitive skin who cannot use makeup wipes. I tried to use it on my eyes and it just made my waterproof eyeliner smudge everywhere and I had to go in with a liquid remover for my eyes. Overall, only get it if you don’t wear waterproof makeup and your face can’t stand makeup wipes.",0
"I have acne and dark marks on my face. This product reduced my acne and brightened up my complexion reducing the look of dark marks. My regime consists of St. Ives blemish control, Alcohol to remove surface impurities, and this product for 10 mins. Then I use the ordinary ( Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2% ) for moisture. The main ingredient is Vitamin C. If you wanna gradually remove dark marks or hyperpigmentation it will help.",2
"This stuff is magic. I am 49 , with combo skin, surface dehydration and large pores. Occasional breakouts. I alternate using this one night and Retin-A the other night. I’ve used Retin -A alone for 20 years. When I added this to my routine my skin drastically improved. Never have breakouts, balances my skin, evens skin tone, and improves the look of my pores and skin overall. I’ve ordered bottle after bottle. It’s my only consistent splurge as far as skin care. I can’t be without it. If I run out I notice a difference almost immediately. My only complaint is the packaging. You can’t see inside the bottle, so when you run out, it’s always a surprise. You can’t see that you are coming to the end. Other than that, it’s my favorite product at Sephora.",2
"Liked the product, didn’t do much but didn’t break me out. It wasn’t until I read the ingredients on the box I realized this just isn’t worth it. I mean the first ingredient is water followed by a bunch of filler ingredients. The price point is great but I would rather save my money for the real stuff. Will be returning this.",0
"After receiving this product complimentary, I didn’t know what to expect. I have high standards in hydrating moisturizer so I’m often disappointed but this product was amazing! It’s so thick and hydrating! The product packaging was so nice and the bottle is a substantial size!",2
I absolutely loved the ease of use with this stick. It glides on my face easily and goes on smooth. I have very sensitive skin and this thankfully did not make my face breakout. The sun finally came out today so I was excited to try this out. Went on the lake and was in the sun all afternoon this kept me burn free so it works! Will purchase in the future for sure!,2
"I hate to do this but the product is so sticky and uncomfortable.  I can’t wear it.  Will be returning.  Nice idea, poorly executed.",0
I love this mask and have been buying it for many years. This time the bottle seemed small so I compared it to my purchase from last spring. 75ml instead of 100ml! Same price for 25% less is absurd! Will be returning.,0
"Received a sample size from Influenster. Love the product, feels amazing on my skin.  Wish I had more as the size only lasted 3 uses. So I can’t really give a review on results. But it did make my skin feel amazing afterwards",2
First time trying this oil.. I loved the texture and the smell is absolutely amazing. Really helps to invoke a relaxing feeling and allow you to enjoy a self care moment. I loved how fast absorbing this product is. Definitely would recommend!,1
"Just wow. I am not one to gush over beauty products, but I am seriously impressed with ExfoliKate...This is one product that lives up to the hype.I purchased the small ($19) tube, just to try, but I will definitely purchase again! It has a green toothpaste-like consistency, and is chock-full of exfoliating enzymes. Even though the “scrubby“ bits don’t feel like they’re exfoliating much, once you rinse off the scrub, you’ll know right away that the gentler enzymes were doing their thing.My normally fair, oily skin was rosy for a few minutes afterward, but not alarmingly so. The benefits continued on into the next day - my skin was smooth and fresh feeling! The package says to only use 2 times per week, and I agree. If you use it any more than that, your results don’t feel the same. It’s almost like your skin builds up a tolerance. I don’t get that first time, long-lasting freshness unless I go 3 or 4 days between treatments.",2
"I recieved this as a free sample and I fell in love already !! I already went in and bought another one! I have oily skin and it literally worked like magic, my face has a complete matte finish all day after applying it in the morning.",2
My skin looks and feels amazing after using this product nightly!,2
"This facial oil is a wonderful addition to my skincare regimen. I like how it absorbs quickly and instantly gives my skin a smooth texture. I like to use it at night by itself. My skin feels extra soft after a good night’s sleep. I didn’t give it five stars because the floral smell is very strong. It reminds me of perfumes from years ago. Besides that,  this oil gets a big thumbs up.",1
I love this stuff! It’s comparable to the too faced primer but better imo. My face doesnt end up feeling dry at the end of the day.,2
"The biggest thing wrong with this product is the instructions. It says to dampen your face first, use the product, then rinse off. Because this is a balm (and an oily one without emulsifiers), using it on damp skin won’t work well. It also won’t rinse off. As the first step in a two-step cleanse, it works, though not that well with mascara. The oil in the product does separate, and you can’t really shake the tube to blend it back together. While it has no added fragrance, it does have an earthy aroma which you may (or may not) like. I’m using it up, but don’t plan to purchase again.",0
"This is a light , very moisturizing serum. So far my skin shows a vast improvement . But, too early to tell about fading brown spots. Worth the money even without that benefit !",2
"While I like the way it feels, love that it’s clear and it did protect as advertised, I have a HORRIBLE breakout from it.  Despite claiming to be unscented, it smells funny as well.",1
"Not sure yet if I limed it or not, the consistensy of this cream feels like an aqua gel or aqua cream, very lightly, which i dont like in this season of the year, i wish it was more moisturizer. After apply it into my skin ot feels so dry, i will keep using it inmy for a week just to see if i see a difference in my pores. No scent at all.",1
"First time purchasing 3 weeks ago. I’ve used it every other day and I find it very sticky when applying, but it does dry smooth. I’ll come back to state if I see/feel a difference in my skin because I don’t see anything visible as yet.",1
My skin glows and looks instantly smoother and brighter after using this product. It’s makes your skin look liken you just got a hydrofacial!,2
#freeproduct from topbox. I liked the consistency of this product.,1
"This stuff is amazing. It does exactly what it claims to do. I have been using it at night to spot treat any pimples and bumps that look like they will get worse. By morning, they are no longer raised or red. It’s a rapid healing miracle worker. It’s now my holy grail product for blemishes. It’s a great value, too, and will last quite a while.My only issue is the smell. It’s 10% sulfur so I knew it was going to stink. The first time I used it was with a one-time use sample. I spot-treated a couple blemishes and went to watch some TV and hang out with my dog, forgetting all about it. I started to notice a bad smell and thought my dog farted. We were both side-eyeing each other for several minutes before I realized it was coming from my face. Yes it smells that bad. But it worked so well I bought the full-sized bottle and have no regrets. (The one-time use swabs would be great for traveling but are otherwise not a good value.)",2
So worth the $! It is extremely soft and so gentle on the eyes especially!,2
"This was my first cleansing balm and I’m really enjoying it! The makeup comes off with minimal effort, and is so much easier than using traditional removers. I’m enjoying this as part of my skincare routine. It smells great, too!",2
"I love this product! It’s so hydrating and makes my lips feel so soft. The only con for me is that it’s in a pot vs a tube, I’d prefer a tube it’s a little less messy and hygienic. But overall, great product.",1
This scrub does everything it says it will. It’s gentle enough for me to use twice a week. It leaves your face feeling fresh with an awesome tingly minty feeling. I have dry skin and this doesn’t leave my skin feeling dried out even though it’s meant for oily skin.,2
Love it so far!! Really melts your makeup off and doesn’t leave grease behind.,2
"I bought these as a recommendation from The Skinny Confidential and now I am obsessed. As a woman in my late 20s I will say I have pretty good skin 95% of the time. However. I do get hormonal cystic acne once a month and after trying a new toner I broke out and freaked out. I had 5 random blemishes and with my olive skin, any blemish becomes red. The first night noticed a much lighter complexion. The second night I almost couldn’t believe my eyes. It stings a little but it’s not over bearing however, I don’t have super sensitive skin either. Try the 5 pack if you’re unsure. I REALLY love this product and will buy the larger pack and try more of his products now. Customer for life. Thanks Dr!!!",2
I was recommended the gel because I have oily/dry skin. I love the gel in the warmer months when there is more moisture in the air. In the winter the gel is not enough. I get really dry on forehead and around my nose and mouth. I use the lotion and it’s a lot better. If you have drier skin the gel isn’t worth it. Just buy this one and you will be set. It’s really worth the money trust me. I haven’t found a lotion like this one.,2
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster to test and review. I’m honestly not sure what this product has been doing for my skin. I’ve been struggling with *maskne* lately and this product has been really lovely, but I don’t know if it’s done anything for me. It feels great on my skin, smells really lovely, and the bottle is nice. The lid is a little annoying to use, but otherwise I like this product.",1
"This stuff is amazing.   I’ve been using La Mer for years and was at Seohora with a friend when the Algenist rep Aaron turned me onto this line.  The liquid collagen is amazing, with the genius cream and eye cream paired with the power night pressed serum.  First time I’ve actually seen and felt a difference.  I’ve been using everything religiously for 30 days and am extremely impressed, especially after using the most expensive products on the market.",2
"This is a great, light cream that works on oily skin. As the name suggests, the texture is halfway between a gel and a cream so it feels very light on the skin and absorbs to leave your skin soft. I wish I’d had this during the summer!",2
"very moisturizing night cream, I’ve been using it for a month (since I received it from influenster) and its been very helpful keeping my skin soft and hydrated. Between winter and mask wearing my skin needed an extra layer of moisture at night to hydrate for the morning and this works good.",2
these are not your strong dr dennis gross peel pads. these are super gentle for those with sensitive skin and minimal skin texture. if u are sensitive or your skin is pretty good and u have just slight texture these are perfect for you they arent super super exfoliating or super strong but if u have good skin and want just a slight exfoliation these will be perfect for you. my skins not sensitive but i dont like using strong peels bc my skin is pretty good i just have some occasional texture and this product helps me a lot it also helps with the black and white heads i get on my nose. overall this is great for someone younger who doesn’t need a lot of exfoliation. if you are more mature or have a lot of texture and scarring i would suggest something stronger.,2
"Wasn’t for this girl’s parched skin.  Since it was marketed towards people with eczema like me, I was hoping it would be my new holy grail, but it kind felt odd on and I didn’t like the way my skin felt when touching it the next day.",0
Best face wash at Sephora. Comparable to my IS Clinical cleansing complex. Gentle yet powerful.,2
"I’ve always struggled with blackheads, so I wanted to love this product so much! But it just was a waste of money, honestly. The product feels awesome and it sticks to the skin so well! I was super excited the first night I tried these. I wore a nose strip overnight and woke up like a kid on Christmas! I ripped it off in excitement and stared at it and immediately became disappointed. Not only did it not pull anything out (believe me, there are blackheads to pull out), but my skin looked exactly the same; the pores were still clogged and the same normal size. I thought maybe it wasn’t because I exfoliate at night and didn’t so before trying this product, so the next time I tried it (a few days later), I did not exfoliate before putting one on. The next morning, nothing. At this point, I figured I better use ‘em all up to get my moneys worth. I also realized that they also have a terrible, faint pee smell. I have 3 dogs and kept feeling like I was smelling pee somewhere but I couldn’t find it! I didn’t realize it until I used the strips for a 3rd time and it finally clicked. Overall, I will NOT be buying these again and definitely wouldn’t recommend them to anyone. If they can’t  work on my blackheads, they surely won’t work for anyone else’s.",0
"I use this once a month as part of my routine. I love that it is a one-step process. My other go to for a monthly peel is two-steps at a time in my life when I have NO TIME for another 10 minutes! This product strikes the right balance of strength of formula without irritation. Especially at this price point. I had acne in my youth and fight melasma now, and this product helps cell turnover to reduce scarring and discoloration. I use a prescription product for my melasma and this product is a great compliment.",1
Love it! So gentle on my skin but works to fight off acne!!,2
"Really gentle cleanser, and leaves my skin feeling clean without that “tight” feeling. A bit pricey, but I’d repurchase a smaller bottle for more product.",1
I received the products for free from influenster and the Inkey list in exchange for my honest review. This cleanser is a thick balm consistency and leaves the skin hydrated after wash. It’s more suitable for fry skin.,1
"While I read of the benefits of pre or double-cleansing, I really wasn’t sold on it till now. I love this for my combo dry thirsty skin. It removes all of my makeup even matte lippies and leaves my skin clean but not stripped or dry. Really helps get me skin prepped for my night routine products and I noticed my skin is less angry - dry, textured- with me since using.Also, a little goes a long way. and it works seamlessly with my skincare routine having no interaction with my other products. Definitely recommend",2
"I always have a hard time finding an eye cream that really makes a difference, but this one really does! It is so hydrating and leaves my under eyes soft and smooth. I have noticed my under eye concealer is going on a lot smoother since using this product. I also really love the applicator tip!",2
I’m super impressed with this item. Results in the first three days.,2
Perfect for dry winter skin. I have very dry skin and this cream is so thick and luxurious. I love it! The scent is subtle but really good. Packaging is beautiful. Highly recommend!!,2
Ordered this online because of all of the amazing reviews but dear God the smell is repulsive. Wish I could’ve given it a chance but had to wash it off immediately to not throw up,0
I only use this on my forehead where it’s more dehydrated and need more hydration. This is a very thick cream so I’m not sure if oily skin types would like this since it could potentially clog you pores.,1
"This is my first time using Tatcha products and I really love this cleanser. The smell is great & subtle. I have oily/ combination skin and I’ve been using this for about a month with no issues. Seems to work really well (especially with removing sunscreen) when I use it with my Foreo Luna scrubber. I am using a dime-size amount every day & a little goes a long way so I think this will last at least another month, maybe 2.",2
I love this soooo much and it’s so refreshing and moisturizing!!! I already am almost finished with mine because I used it so much. Just next time I want to try the cream instead of the gel cause that one feels even better,2
This is the best moisturizer I’ve used. The product gets absorbed quickly and I no longer have dry patches on my skin.,2
This Rosebud lip balm is awesome!I use it every night at bed time and it leaves lips moist and wonderful!I refuse to ever have chapped lips again!,2
"My skin feels so much younger and bouncy when I use this product. I replaced a step in my skincare routine with this product as my moisturizer and not only has my skin improved when it comes to dewieness, but it also improves how my makeup sticks to my face.",2
Best face cleaner my face has ever used! It’s the only cleaner that really helps clear my skin!,2
I love this stuff! I take it with me everywhere. It is smooth and glossy and adds a little bit glow. I use it mainly on my lips when they are dry and cracked and soon they are smooth and don’t irritate. But it works great as a light gloss and it also smells divine! A must-have for everyone!,2
"I’ve been struggling with my pores recently and this mask has really been visibly helping them. The only reason I knock one star off is because it slightly burns as it dries. But when it’s dry it’s very tight and washes off with warm water gently, so you don’t have to aggressively scratch at your face with a towel to get it off. I started out with the small size but will purchase the full size",1
"i like the texture of it and the fact that there’s not really a smell to it, does not irritate my skin and leaves it very hydrated in the morning",1
"I have never written a review on here, but love many products. I received this in my April Play box and have absolutely seen a difference in the lines on my neck area. I am 46 years old and have pretty great skin.  However, have not found anything that can help with previous sun damage until now. I have started my daughter on this regimen as well. I love Dr. Dennis Gross, Philosophy, and Peter Thomas Roth products, but this definitely does what it says it will do- love it!",2
Been considering this product for years and finally purchased a few weeks ago.  It is really amazing.  I noticed an immediate difference in the brightness of my skin.  With continued use I have noticed an improvement to the overall texture of my skin.  Will defintely repurchase.,2
"I love this soap. The only reason for the 3 star review is I hate the bottle and the pump. It leaks everywhere, makes a mess, and is just a waste. Please please please fix the bottle+pump. I love this soap, but given how much leaks out it’s just a waste and I can’t stomach it.",1
"Look, I don’t know what y’all consider to be “oily“ skin. But I have McDonald’s french fries levels of grease, yet somehow no acne on my face. I really wanted to like this product! But I genuinely don’t understand the hype. My skin has NEVER looked greasier than it does when I use this cream -- and I’ve been to Cambodia during the hottest month of the year with 100% humidity!! This cream felt like nothing on my skin, and not in a good way. It doesn’t absorb into my skin. It didn’t make my skin feel hydrated at all, yet throughout my 12 hour shift at the hospital I had to continuously blot my face with freaking *paper towels* that I could SEE THROUGH!!! after pressing ONCE onto my face. Then my skin would be just as greasy again 30 minutes later. Even my Tatcha blotting paper did nothing against this mess. To top it all off, I had pimples on my face the next day, which I almost never get. This was the only change I made to my skincare routine. If you don’t believe me, sort the reviews by “oiliness“ under Concerns and look at all the 1 and 2 star reviews that say the same thing. As for the good reviews from people with dry or normal skin, of course your skin is gong to feel soft if you use this -- that’s likely just the silicone sitting on top of your face, artificially softening it. I’m actually happy for those who consider this their Holy Grail product. But for me at least, overall this is EXTREMELY overpriced and you’re just paying for the brand name and ~fancy~ ingredients. I mean, come on, GOLD as an ingredient? how silly. I’m just glad I bought the trial size.",0
I received a sample and had to get the full size. I have combination skin that gets dry in the winter and this immediately helped with those dry patches. This also seemingly cleared up blemishes and scars. My favorite way to apply this is to pat the oil on top of my moisturizer OR mixing a few drops in with my moisturizer. LOVE!(I’ve also tried Acure marula oil but the quality of Drunk Elephant’s oil seems better and does not have an oily scent),2
I’ll never stop buying this! Its not too “fancy” or anything but I’ve been using this product for a year now and it’s plumped up my skin and definitely straightened my skin barrier. It’s just a must have.,2
"This stuff is so good!! It smells amazing and I really feel like it plumps my face when it moisturizes. I use as directed; morning and night, and it’s made my face so soft and hydrated. I would definitely buy again!",2
"You wouldn’t think such an inexpensive item will do much, but it sure does ! I was a little scared That it will irritate my very sensitive skin but it didn’t I did feel a slight tingle at first but that went away after using it a few days. I’m almost done with this product and I can see that my skin looks smoother and more even and it has a nice glow to it but I didn’t have before.",2
"I have been using this twice a day for 3 weeks now. it does almost instantly make my skin softer, but no other changes seen it noticed by me or anyone yet...for the price, it’s disappointing if all I’m going to get out of it is softer skin!",0
I am in love with this moisturizer it’s one of the best I’ve ever bought I first got the sample and had to buy the full size version. It’s so hydrating and it cleared up my skin so beautifully. I definitely recommend it for people of all skin types!,2
This doesn’t make my oily skin more oily! I love it! I received this product complimentary.,2
I really wanted to like this product because I suffer from moderate acne and an uneven skin tone. I have been using this since it arrived a week ago and I have noticed some improvement to my skin tone and texture. I expected it to sting immediately because it is winter and I can I have sensitive skin. It didn’t sting right away but it started to burn after about 30 seconds. I just applied moisturizer on top and the stinging instantly stopped. Complimentary from Sunday Riley.,2
"Amazing product! I went into Sephora a week and a half ago looking for a new moisturizer and was introduced to this. The skincare specialist introduced this to me as I have dry eczema inspired skin, especially around the eye area. This moisturizer completely cleared it up after about a week use and has left my eye area moisturized and clear of any flaking or redness. Highly recommend this product!",2
"I have never worn foundation, I just don’t like it and was never able to find one that looked natural on my extremely pale skin. I saw an article on this product and stopped in to Sephora for a sample. After a week, I was hooked and bought a full-size jar. More than a tinted moisturizer, more than a BB cream, this stuff just makes naked skin look so much better. I have large pores and some redness, and this disguises those issues extremely well. For me, the key is to moisturize well before using and then only use a small amount and rub in thoroughly. With the small amount you need, one jar will last a long time, so it’s well worth the cost. I would definitely recommend this product for those looking to correct redness, mask small imperfections and/or go foundation-free!",2
This stuff is amazing. If you have sensitive skin I recommend you try this—it’s so gentle on your skin you’ll feel how soft it is afterwards and you also don’t need too much to take off your makeup.,2
"I Love this product. At 48 yo my skin has redness issues and sun spots. This works very well and matches my skin tone perfectly. I use it as a fondation mixed with my primer for house wear when I am not going somewhere. I top it off with powder to create a foundation look , then apply my colors. It also moisturizers and washes off clean. A bit pricey but well worth it.",2
Effects take a while to take affect but decent even with the price range its in. Super hydrate in the morning so if you have ridiculously oily skin be careful!,1
"It works but is outrageously priced. I received a sample with a previous order and was able to try this for about ten days applying every night and my skin is clearer and brighter. It is definitely a noticeable difference which starts pretty well in the first few days but at this price, it’s very hard to justify. I have purchased a well-reputed dupe for less than ten dollars to see if it is comparable but I don’t see myself purchasing at this price point.",1
"This is not good for oily skin. It’s very heavy and leaves a lot of oil after you apply it. I’ve been researching the probiotic claims and I’m not finding anything showing applying it to your skin does anything. It needs to be ingested. Lastly, it smells terrible. Not a fan at all. I got this as a free sample.",0
Love this product! I have a mix skin condition and sometimes I have very oily skin sometimes I have really dry skin. Every time I have a dry skin I would use it because it kept me moisture and last the whole day.,2
The smell is fresh and nice. I feel good after using this product. My face is not dry or sticky after use. My only concern is: I think I will finish whole bottle in 2 months. I have to refill it very often.,1
This just made my lips worse. Nothing about it helped my lips in anyway. It made them prone to dry and cut lips,0
"I received this in the sunscreen kit with a bunch of other ones. I really am enjoying this the most. I thought it was matte, but it’s not. It leaves me a little dewy, which is okay, but I wanna go for the mattescreen next from this brand. It goes on easy and feels nice. No smell either. It’s not oily, which is the best part for me. It feels like it’s supposed to be matte because it has this texture that feels thick and dry, but it leaves just a slight shine. I’m just done with any shine right now. So mattescreen it is! Definitely recommend! Big step up from Sun Bum, which left my skin hella shiny.",1
"I saw this MannyMUA use this product in one of his videos and had to try it. I’m glad I did! I takes off all my Makeup and does not irritate y skin. I love Clinique products and wonder why I didn’t try this before, now that I have I will definitely make this part of my skincare routine",2
"I loove this moisturizer! It makes me skin feel very hydrated but doesn’t make my face feel oily! It’s a great light moisturizer for the summer. It does have a light scent, but doesn’t bother me too much. It makes my skin feel sooo soft!",2
Goes on smooth not greasy. Feels great on the face definitely can see the moisture is making my face look better we’ll definitely keep using,2
I started out with the starter size of this cream and i really loved it but since it was pricy i tried out another brand of moisturizer and it totally broke me out all the time and my skin really loves this product so now i own the largest size it really does absorb to your face beautifully!!!,1
"Fresh makes some of my favorite products and this serum is no exception. It’s lightweight and wears well both at night and during the day under makeup. After using it for the last few weeks, I’ve noticed a visible difference in the way my skin looks and feels. It’s hydrated, glowy and my fine lines seem to have softened a bit. Overall texture and tone also improved. It is a bit pricey, but worth every penny - liquid gold! Plus, it has the loveliest scent that’s light and subtle. Fresh for the win, again.",2
"I’ve looked into so many different sunscreens: Shiseido, Krave Beauty’s The Beet Shield, LaRoche-Posey, Peter Thomas Roth, Lancôme, Coola, the list goes on. I could never find a sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white cast and finally something better than I could’ve ever asked for! The sunscreen itself is clear and it leaves a silky finish. I highly recommend this to all my friends and have bought extras as gifts for family!",2
"When I bought this, I had hopes of it making my skin feel great with a slight glow. While the glow was perfect, my skin was far from it. I’ve used this product for the past few days, and my skin has started to flake from drying out so much. It also feels like it sits on my skin, rather than soaking in.",0
"Amazing couldn’t be happier, makes skin smooth and silky!",2
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! As a woman with very pale and sensitive skin, THANK YOU! I love that this is SPF and doubles as a primer. I will continue to purchase this stuff as long as they make it. My makeup goes on flawlessly and the added SPF protection is just icing on the cake. Thank you supergoop!",2
"When stubborn zits appear, the only thing that gets them gone is a PTR Max Complexion Correction Pad - gentle enough to use 2x/day, fierce enough to banish the bacteria-laden blemish forever without damaging any skin.",2
"I received this product for free from influenster to test and revie. So, the pros, I love the texture and the fact that it did not leave any sticky or slick feeling residue. I also really liked the packaging even of the deluxe sample size. Estée Lauder’s packaging really gives off a high end feel. The product did not have a strong odor that I could tell which was a positive for me as well. So the downside, I had a bit of acne flare up while using, I am wondering if this would have calmed down with long term use. I do think that others will see very positive results as I do feel that it is a quality product. I also would consider myself using this again for a longer period to see if my acne would calm down and if it was just because it was a new addition to my skin care routine.",1
"My only issue with this product is that it is marketed as a moisturizer, when it has more of a serum consistency. It has a great smell and doesn’t clog my pores or break out my skin. However, I find that I need to use another moisturizer on top of this product because if I use only Pink Juice and primer under makeup, my skin will get a little flaky.",1
"So soft and light! I am seeing a huge difference in the texture of my skin. Not only is it much brighter, but the fine lines seem to be vanishing before my very eyes. Can’t wait to see the long term affect",2
"This broke me out even AFTER a course of accutane. There are a lot of other great peptide-oriented products out there to explore, so I’d recommend to skip this one.",0
"Nice cottons, do not absorb all the product.",2
"I love that there is no sent to this lotion. It’s not sticky or overly creamy, so it isn’t hard to rub it in completely to your face. It soaks in quickly and doesn’t leave my face feeling oily after. My face feels so smooth, which is a hard thing to do in the winter. Definitely impressed with this face lotion.",1
"I SO wanted to love this product. A  Sephora staff member recommended it to me, as I have red hair/fair skin and my face tends to redden often.  I loved the consistency, the super thickness, and it felt great on my skin. Sadly, like a few others here, I broke out within a day. I thought perhaps the breakout was hormone related (though I break out extremely rarely), so I waited and tried again a few weeks later. Still another breakout. Such a shame. I really wanted to love this!",1
I received a sample from the brand but I started use this product more than 10 years ago. You don’t feel how good it is until you stopped using it. It calms problem skin very much but you must follow the instruction to use it otherwise it will be too thick and hard to apply. I found it also melted with some serum well.,1
"I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts from pretty much everything. This glycolic acid toner is simply INCREDIBLE. I apply it every night and wake up with smooth, soft glowy skin. No breakouts and pigmentation from previous breakouts is almost completely gone. It did tingle burn slightly when I first started using it but over time this sensation faded for me. Adore this one, total gem.",2
This eye sleeping mask is AMAZING. It’s the perfect consistency and does exactly what it says it does. I notice huge improvement in my under eye area already!,2
"This was overall an amazing cleansing balm!Effectiveness: Pretty good! This was where I docked off a star, just because it wasn’t as effective at removing some parts of my makeup as other cleansing balms I’ve tried. Of course, the balm is the 1st part of my double cleanse, but it should take off around 90%-95% of my makeup before I go in with a water-based cleanser. I found that even after gently rubbing this around my eyes, it had a hard time removing some waterproof mascara and magnetic lash liner. I’ve had other cleansing balms/oils (i.e. Farmacy, Caudalie, and Banila Co) that have taken off pretty much all my makeup in one go, so I have high expectations for cleansing balms and can be sometimes harsh judging them. If you don’t wear a ton of makeup, you can definitely consider this product because it will not have a problem with removing it! But if you do wear heavier makeup on occasions, just be warned you may need to do a second round with this cleansing balm!Scent: It has a light, non-irritating scent that is similar to a lot of their other aqua bomb products! I am not normally affected by scents in products, so definitely keep that in mind. It isn’t heavily perfumed/scented like other brands (i.e Fresh, Kiehl’s).Texture: Great texture! This is like most balm textures - it starts as a solid and it scrapes very easily with the included spatula. Once you rub it between your hands and heat the product up, it has great “slip“ to it and spreads onto the face very smoothly. It isn’t hard to rub into your skin like other balms and it glides over your skin and eyes without really putting too much effort in. I really hate when balms make me really work and put elbow grease into rubbing the product into my skin as I try to be very gentle when applying facial products.",1
i like the smell of it .and the bottle is so beautiful .the design is good.,2
I received this as #freeproduct. It is suitable for all skin types and mine is normal skin. it didn’t made my skin oily as it blends well. Works well to reduce dark circles and puffiness around the eyes,2
I’m not much in favor of rose fragrances...they make my nose scrunch. But I LOVE this balm! It smells good and feels great on my lips. It definitely is very moisturizing!! I like this better than Rosebud Salve because it doesn’t smell too rosey and I feel that it isn’t as thick.,2
I use this cleanser every single night. It’s amazing. Smells good. Feels good. Love the glass bottle and it’s clean!,2
Now that I’m getting older my skin is really dry. I used this and I’m good for the rest of the day.,2
"Gentle on skin, great cleanser.",2
"Loved this moisturizer! It is very hydrating, soaks up well, and worked great on my sensitive skin. I also liked that it does not have an overpowering scent.",2
"I received this as a free sample from Influenster.  I am a Tatcha fan an the Rice Wash Skin-Softening Cleanser does not disappoint.  I use it day and night and I have noticed a big difference in the look and feel of my skin.  It is so soft!  My skin is sensitive and this did not irritate my skin.  Try it,  you will not be disappointed!",2
"I loved this product. I got it as a sample from pinchme. I used it right after showering. Usually when I use a serum type product after shower my skin still fells kind of dry and tight and I usually follow it up with a moisturizer. With the bareminerals serum, my face felt so hydrated and smooth, without any tackiness. I didn’t feel like I still had to use moisturizer. Love it!",2
"This was okay. I was using it as a 1st cleanse/oil cleanser and then switched it to my AM cleanse and it was fine. Hard to get out of the tube because it’s so thick. It does leave an oily/waxy feel on your face that felt hard to come off, but it didn’t seem to irritate my skin or cause any breakouts. I don’t think I’ll repurchase.",0
One of the most gentle aha serums i’ve used! The honey really helps keep my skin moisturized even tho the AHA is a chemical exfoliant. In the morning i feel my face feel smoother (but i also use other AHA products like glow recipes sleeping mask in addition)I would definitely repurchase when i run out!,2
"Can’t believe I have never tried lip enhancement products before. Within 5 days goodbye crusty dusty chips, hello soft voluptuous lips!! It smells amazing what more do you need in a lip mask I wore it during the day and my results still blew me away. As a Caribbean Canadian I thought these products are only for “those people“ I was rudely surprised when the dead skin started peeling off and a softer layer of skin appeared. Don’t knock this till you try it, you definely regret it if you don’t.",2
"I have had the driest skin during this winter plus pregnancy. I’ve tried everything from Clinique to drunk elephant to eminence, this is the first product that’s helped banish my flaky skin and bring back a soft healthy glow. I can’t say enough good things about this and I just bought it two days ago.",2
"This product is amazing! I got the sample size of it when I redeemed my points of off Sephora and I loved it so much I had to buy the full size. Best purchase i think I’ve ever made in my life. It is a gentle cleanser that also has gentle exfoliating beads. It cleans ur skin so well but not too harshly so ur face isn’t left feeling dry or irritated. This works very well especially with a face cleansing electric brush too! I do have pretty clear skin but since I started using the products I have like close to none white heads or blackheads. And I haven’t gotten a pimple since. It’s almost been a full moth since I started using this product and I’ve loved ever second of it. If you are willing to invest ur money in an amazing skin care product, please invest in this one! You won’t be sorry, it’s truly my new holy grail skin care product in my skin care routine.",2
This balm is so luxurious! It glides on so well and does a really great job at breaking down my make up so that i can wipe it right off. Its the only way i can avoid raccoon eyes after washing my face! ONLY downside is it does have fragrance in it (which isn’t good for your skin) HOWEVER you are only using it for a minute or so before you wipe it off so i don’t see how it can be irritating like fragrance is in products you leave on the skin. It does smell nice! I have acne prone skin and this does not break me out. I wear make up every day and this has lasted me 3 months. On the fence? Try out the Sephora rewards sample size- enough products for two weeks for 100 pts. Perfect for traveling.,2
"I actually came here to repurchase this and figured I’d write a review while I’m here. I’ll preface it by saying that the first product I tried from this brand was the Vitamin C serum, which I absolutely love. It has significantly reduced areas of discoloration caused by the sun, and all but eliminated my acne. My skin is so much clearer and softer, and even though I only had the finest of lines, I don’t see them anymore. It is easily the best and most effective skincare product I have ever used, so I already trust this brand implicitly.I’ve never had good experiences with AHAs. They’ve always been too harsh for my skin and never improved my acne. So many of the reviews for this serum claimed vastly retexturized skin without irritation, I had to try it.I don’t think I experienced the degree of retexturization I’d hoped to. Some people don’t believe “purging“ is a thing that happens with exfoliating products. If I didn’t before, I certainly do after using this. I had a lot of clogged pores on the sides and very bottom of my chin. They got worse before they got better, that’s for sure. But a couple weeks later, they were much better. That said, after about a month I wasn’t sure how much this serum was helping and I went back to using just the Vitamin C serum. The clogged pores returned. I started using this again, went through a much less horrifying purging process, and now I’m back to buy more. Although it hasn’t completely eliminated the clogged pores on my chin, it has worked better than anything else I’ve tried. And with hardly any irritation. Probably one day a week I don’t put it on at night because my skin starts to feel sensitive. Those nights I just use a moisturizer alone.Drunk Elephant, again, seems to have succeeded where so many others have failed. This serum is expensive, but it works and it doesn’t make my skin look bad like exfoliants and acids usually do, so I’ll keep buying it.",1
This product made my skin feel very smooth and it is lightweight.,1
"Love the Dr Hart products! This Cicapair Tiger Grass Color Correcting Treatment, came in a neat little zip bag along with, the serum, cream, and calming mist. I have dry sensitive skin, and wanted to have something that worked on the days when I didn’t want to wear a foundation. Wow! All the products are good, but this color correcting treatment is exactly what I was looking for. It goes on green, but as you rub it in it adapts to the color of your skin, and feels really moisturizing, without feeling heavy. Great for covering redness!.Will definitely purchase again!",2
I adore these exfoilating wipes! They do a great job on days that I am not wanting to use my Clarisonic. These are a holy grail for me!,2
"I have combination acne prone skin with large pores and redness. I pretty much have given up on finding anything that does what it says, until I tried these correction pads. I noticed within a week that my skin feels soft and my pores were minimized. When I do break out these days it’s this tiny pimple that vanishes without a trace within 2 days. I do cut the pads in half per other reviews making this product even more affordable! This product gave me life!!",2
Amazing! This is one of my absolute favorite products ever :) It really is great on everything. Use it once on your lips and they’ll already be amazing. Definite must-have in any collection.,2
"Love my other Dermalogica products, but this is just okay. I kept it and use every now and then, but I wouldn’t repurchase.",0
"Sooo good! Doesn’t leave a white cast (obviously lol), feels so good it’s sunscreen but feels like a makeup primer. Leaves my skin matte and soft. Makeup applies so good on it, it’s Literally amazing. Bought the smaller version first and had to get the full size.",2
"If you’re thinking of trying these I say go for it! I got the grapefruit. I am not a fan of products with strong scents and I was concerned that the scent of these wipes would be overpowering but for me it isn’t. These wipes do a pretty decent job at removing my make-up. However, it did not do much for removing waterproof mascara, hence my reason for giving 4 stars. I found the exfoliating side a bit too harsh for my skin, but if your skin can handle it then you’d probably be ok with using it. For the price I think its worth a try, I used these for a little over a month and overall had no negative effects.",1
"I have sensitive combination skin, and I live in a variable weather area (hello, Midwest!). I used to think that antioxidant skin care was a gimmick, but this brand changed my mind completely. My skin feels so good and clean after I wash with this cleanser - never dry or tight. It helps to remove any vestiges of my makeup, and I also love the recyclable packaging! I am on my second bottle and will most definitely buy again.",2
I’ve wanted to try this for a while and it exceeded all my expectations! I love the smooth texture and how evenly it applies on the skin. I suffer from dry skin and this cream made my skin very moisturized and glowy,2
"Amazing product for my skin, I don’t have acne but I always get little bumps on my temple or jaw line. They disappear with this mask.",2
Is really a bomb of moisturizing. My skin was flaky because of winter and this saved me. I used morning and night after cleansing my face and within two days I felt my skin hydrated again. The texture is great and doesn’t stay sticky.,2
"This is great the morning after my SR retinol and makes my skin glow even more! I recommend this product even with the price tag, it just cannot be beat!",2
"This toner blew me away. It’s unlike any other toner I have tried, and it feels amazing on my skin. I’ve only been using it for the past few days, but my pores are already noticeably smaller. My sister even commented on how glowy my skin looked, and the only thing I had changed about my skincare routine was use this toner. Also, this toner has a light almost floral scent to it unlike the harsh chemical smell of toners I have used in the past. I definitely recommend trying this toner out.",2
"I love this oil.  I use it during the day or night (even though it is meant for night) and it keeps my skin moisturized without leaving it greasy.  Some other oils I’ve used would leave a greasy film on top of my skin and this doesn’t.  I like the texture and the ease of absorption of this oil, which for me is a must, since I don’t have all day waiting for it to absorb. Definitely will repurchase this oil.",2
I’ve been using this product for over a week and I really enjoy it. My skin feels refreshed and hydrated. Very pleasant fragrance and texture. I was sent this by Influenster for review although I was going to purchase on my own. I will definitely keep this as apart of my skincare regimen.,2
This is a great primer/treatment.  I love everything about this product.,2
"I love a good eye cream!!! This instantly took the puffiness off of my eye area. My makeup looked so nice over it. My eye area also felt so much more hydrated, smooth, and brighter!! The whipped texture felt so nice and not heavy when applied. I would purchase this eye cream in the future when it comes back in stock because it seems like it would be amazing long term.",2
"Get. It. This stuff is great with cell turnover, which helps with a lot of skin concerns. Right when I put this on my face my skin started to tingle, when I went to take it off, my pores were substantially smaller and it felt like my skin was breathing & my skin looked glowing. I already can tell I will see great results when I use this more.",2
"Out of all of the serums I’ve used, this is my favorite.  This has greatly improved the texture of my skin.  My skin is hydrated and firmer, and my skin tone is much more even than before.  When I apply this, it feels like my skin just drinks its in.  It’s light, but nourishing.(I received this product for free for testing purposes.  I plan to repurchase when I run out.)",2
I so wanted this to work since I’m sick of  trying different eye creams lately and there was a lot of great reviews. My eye area is sensitive and getting dry as we head into winter. After a week the area started to tingle when i applied it  and then after 10 days it started to flake and was worse with makeup. I don’t mind spending money on a product if it’s beneficial and works but sadly this did not. I returned it. For me tatcha products are hit or miss. This was a miss.,0
I am IN love with this! Leaves my lips constantly feeling amazing.,2
I got this in a sample set with the moisturizer. I have combination skin and struggle with cystic acne on my cheeks and acne on chin.I used this for 2 weeks and I immediately felt softer skin after washed and it felt hydrated and clean. I bought the large size and it’s been 2 months. my skin is more smooth and even texture. barely any acne on my chin and my cheeks mostly cleared up. I wear  N95s at work so it’s impossible to avoid maskne. The price is actually reasonable considering I only need a pea size amount for each wash. highly recommend!,2
"I’ve been using it for two weeks and I strongly dislike it. It lathers up so nicely, but the smell is disgusting and it’s way too stripping. I also have been breaking out after using this. Overall it has just not worked for me. I wish you better luck. If you do buy get mini size so you’re not stuck with a big bottle. I’ll stick with my Cetaphil thank you very much.",0
"First impression, super cute packaging. The box looks expensive and the weight of the container is significant, which gives it a fancy vibe. When I opened the container, the plastic meant to separate the gel and the lotion wasn’t doing it’s job. Some of the gel had gotten into the lotion and some gel had also escaped from the side of the jar. The product would benefit from an applicator that comes with it, but since it didn’t have one I used a silicone brush I own. The gel smells very faintly of rose, which is fine for me because I don’t *love* rose scents, so this was a happy medium. I do think the mask brightened my skin but the instructions say not to rinse it off, i find that difficult to believe because it doesn’t absorb into the skin very easily. I rinsed it off and then applied the overnight mask. I loved the feel of the mask, it absorbed beautifully and left my skin dewey and with a natural glow. I recently got some sun and this product definitely helped moisturize my face to retain my tan. Overall I would recommend this product for intense hydration for your face. I do think it needs some instruction and packaging tweaks. I was given this product by Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Hope this helps inform your purchase!",1
"The smell is very good, my skin is super bright and beautiful, this product does a great job, i love it.",2
"I received this free from Influenster for testing purposes - this is my honest review. I thought this was a nice serum.  Great feel to it, nice scent, and I thought it worked.  Its just a bit pricey for me, so I can’t give it 5 stars.",1
"This moisturized my lips very well, but I could not get past the scent or the fact that it was a bit gooey.",1
"I was a bit hesitant when buying this product as I’ve heard several reviewers saying the fragrance was very strong. Even though I agree in a sense, the mask isn’t on your face for long so it won’t be too irritating. I was looking for a physical exfoliant as I had a bit of flakiness, and right after I used this product my skin felt like a baby and it gently helped exfoliate my dead skin. Would recommend this product, just be careful if you have super sensitive skin!",1
"This is the best cleanser I have ever used! It takes off all of my makeup and doesn’t burn my eyes. I have been using it for over a week now and have noticed my acne clearing up and my makeup doesn’t settle in my smile lines as much, which could be the help from the spray in the same collection. I have oily acne prone skin with signs of aging and this has been by far the best thing I have done for my skin!",2
"I was excited to try this brand out! I have semi-noticeable pores and needed something fast acting. I start using this cream before bed and noticed subtle changes within a week. I also have sensitive skin and this did not cause any issues at all. My face also felt tighter which was great! The product is cute, safe, and cost effective!",2
"Keeps acne under control. However, it doesn’t completely cure it! Also for only oily forehead and chin people your cheeks will start to dry out so be aware.",1
Grains are large so it feels quite abrasive on the skin! It didn’t feel like it was cleansing my skin and rather left me with breakouts. The fragrance is amazing but didn’t work effectively. I highly recommend The Farmacy exfoliator or the Tatcha rice polish cleanser; both are amazing and way more gentler for everyday use!!,0
"I’ve tried a bunch of HA intensifiers all to varying degrees of success, and most very pricey. This is the best one I’ve tried so far. I also have experienced breakouts with other HA products, and some that include B5 for additional hydrating effects. Love the ingredients, that it’s a clean product, and the price tag.",2
"I received this product complimentary from Goopglow. Before receiving it, I used a daily exfoliating scrub in the shower, and then every few days I’d do a chemical exfoliating mask that I have to leave on for 20 minutes, which was not ideal. This Goopglow Microderm Instant Glow Exfoliator combines the two and it works fantastically. I love the convenience of this product, it’s very easy to apply and remove. It’s gentle but effective - it leaves my face looking and feeling super soft and smooth. There’s no redness or flakiness after using. It only has to be left on my face for 3 minutes and only used a few times a week. It’s a really nice product. I like that it has a soft scent - it doesn’t smell like anything was added for scent purposes only, it smells like a combination of all the oils and extracts that are in it and it’s nice. The downside is that it’s a bit pricey and the container is small so you’re not getting a lot of product for the hefty price tag.",2
"I actually quite like this product. I feel like it has diminished the fine lines on my lips to a degree. I was questionable about the large size but I have learned how to maneuver it. However, I do find it very expensive for the amount of product you get and it is not super moisturizing. I personally use it as a barrier when I’m doing my skin care to not get retinol near my lips and then before I go to bed I apply a more occlusive lip care product. I would re-purchase but I would like to see the price reduced.",1
"One of the best products I’ve used! I use this at night after retinol or acids, and I’m glowing in the morning! My skin is dry/combo/on the sensitive side, and it takes to this moisturizer perfectly. It is a thick cream, so don’t expect it to be watery or gel like.",2
"Honestly, this product lives up to its hype!! What I love is that it super infuses your lips with moisture without the intense peeling you get from other moisture products. The smell is amazing, not really a flavor to it which I don’t mind. Most shiny and perfect lip mask I’ve ever had!",2
"I tried this out because I’ve been trying to find a good sunscreen to use every day. Unfortunately, no matter if I put this on completely bare skin, or after skincare, it always pills up so badly that there is no more product on my face.",0
"SO SO good!! Love for transition from summer to fall, keeps my skin feeling healthy",2
"Love this eye creme!!! Goes on silky smooth and instantly absorbs into skin,a little goes a long way.i have no visible lines and the eye crease below my bottom lid has even improved in just under two weeks.i have a much better looking complexion around my eye area,visibly more bright and dark circles have improved alot(I either sleep too much or not all).this eye creme is definitely a game changer and I plan to purchase in the future.",2
"I always read reviews about people finding their “holy grail” product and it’s never worked out for me. This is a total game changer, though. I use this with the alpha beta pore serum and my skin texture is so smooth. I have acne scar indentation and have tried everything. So far this is working!!",2
"Works really good, it didn’t make my face feel oily and worked really good for my face. My face felt smooth and fresh. First time trying it and it helped me a lot.",1
"I bought this to remove my SPF and makeup nightly as a double cleanse. I would only recommend using this as a first cleanser because it leaves a residue behind on your skin (which is hydrating but not what I want). According to the packaging you can use it as a mask so on the days I shower before bed (no makeup days) I apply this and work it into my skin and then hop into the shower to let the steam really work the product into my skin. Then I rinse off after I’m done showering and follow up with my second cleanser. This always leaves my skin feeling so smooth and hydrated on the days when I need a little extra moisture. The one downside is that the packaging sucks and I had product leak out and sometimes the oil separates and I have to shake i, but it is a very low price. Overall I like how it removes my makeup, you just have to really rub the product in which you should be doing for at least 60sec anyways, and I would purchase this again.",1
I noticed an immediate difference when I used this! I received a sample but will buy this and make it part of my nightly routine.,2
eyeliner smudged from last night- no more! I can’t wear makeup without having this guy on hand anymore. Its hands down the best makeup remover I’ve ever used.,2
"This product literally has the cutest packaging! It also smells really good and feels great on the skin! I received this product free for review from Influenster, but I plan to purchase this product on my own once it runs out!",2
"I have super sensitive, combination, acne prone rosacea skin so with everything I read about this brand I was really hopeful. Unfortunately, the oil seems to have been too thick and after a couple of days use caused a small breakout and flakiness along my jaw. I thought the oil felt really nice though, but when I stopped using it the breakout cleared up. Luckily I just tried a sample, so thankful Sephora gives that option! I like my sample of the Lala whip so far, not ready to give up on trying this brand!",0
Love love this toner! I don’t think I can live without this toner now!,2
This mask makes my lips so smooth and hydrated the next morning. It’s been my go-to for a long time and I will continue to use it over anything else. I’m really not sure what more you could ask for from a lip mask,2
Bought the 1 oz bottle just to try out & I would not recommend this. It is very sticky and thick and does not apply evenly. You can use the serum with another moisturizer.,0
"I tried this by the recommendation on a whim. It’s OK. It feels good, but hasn’t made any change in my complexion at all. The 24 hour moisturizer does a much better job of keeping my face hydrated. I’ll use this until it is gone, but won’t buy it again.",0
"excelente toner vi resultados en días, uno de mis favoritos",2
"I’ve repurchased this again! It’s so lovely. Smells great, perfect for dry/normal skin. Didn’t notice a lot in terms of pigmentation or creating more even texture but I wake up with my face feeling more moisturized and soft. I use this every other night in my routine",1
"Complementary from Dermatologica sampling. Gifted by Dermatologica This is a wonderful product. It’s my first time using it and I love how my face feels after  I used it leaves my skin feeling soft, clean and smooth.Definitely I’ll buy it.",2
"Absolutely in love with this product! My skin was noticeably more hydrated the morning after using this product. My skin felt very soft and looked plumped and healthy the next morning. The rose scent is fresh and very enjoyable, not the perfumey rose scent some products have. I really enjoyed the two step process. I could really feel the second step locking in the moisture from the first step step. Pro tip: use a sheet mask before applying for INSANELY hydrated skin!! This was my first product from Fresh and now I can’t wait to try more! This product is in pre-production and is not the final product. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",2
"I’ve been using this ever since I ran out the Clinique acne solutions cleanser for a week now, and it seems to be just as good. I haven’t had any breakouts or irritation of any sort. The cleanser has no smell & cleans well.",1
Received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido. This is a good sunscreen for dry skin types. It wore nicely under my makeup and didn’t leave a white cast. Made my skin feel hydrated as well. Light-weight and did not break me out. Has the sunscreen scent but it does not bother me. I’d recommend this sunscreen for dry skin types.,2
"my favorite product! im on my 3rd tube now, which has never happened with any other brand before haha a light coat gives long lasting, non waxy coverage or can be use as a base for colored balms etc.",2
This product has been great for my skin! I use it after my usual skin care routine before I put on makeup. Sometimes I’ll mix it with my foundation and it applies so much more smoothly and my skin looks so glowy. I’ve definitely noticed an improvement!,2
"I’d been researching for awhile and heard AMAZING things so I finally pulled the trigger during the sephora sale.  I’ve noticed a big improvement in the overall texture of my skin and my dark spots are def lighter.  In conjunction with cream based cleanser, HLA, retinol, grow recipe Niacinamide and Kiehs moisturizer I’m like a glowing goddess without the oil! I’m an oily skin type, but want to battle all things antiaging without feeling like I’m wearing a blanket of grease on my face... This product helps me do just that! I use once a day at bedtime and have recommended my dry skin type friends use twice a week to start as it may dry you out at first (just like a retinol).",2
"I use this at night to remove my makeup before cleansing. It removes everything, including all eye makeup, and it doesn’t cause my skin to break out (which is a biggie for me because everything causes my skin to break out). I’ve been using this for about 2 years and I’ve only gone through 3 containers. It lasts for.ev.er. Apparently, a lot of people have caught wind of how awesome this stuff is, because it’s suddenly sold out everywhere! Maybe I should leave a negative review so less people will buy it. ;)",2
This particular product is amazing! Fixes all the over dry patches or when my face is especially dry. I have used it all over my body but it even works on my over oily face without breaking it out. I have not been impressed by other First Aid products but this one is worth it!,2
"Love this dream mask, it goes on light but your skin feels instantly more hydrated and you wake up dewy and glowing! The delicious fragrance is just a bonus!",2
"I received this product complimentary through Influenster and was so excited to try it. After my first few uses, my initial impression is WOW!! The product feel light on my skin, literally my skin drinks it up! My skin is left feeling soft and supple without any residue or stickiness. Using for a few days, you definitely can see how healthy my skin looks. I look forward to seeing results from continued use!",1
"LOVE! I have pale, sensitive skin that pulls red when cold or dry or the wind is blowing from the east. This is a soothing cream that makes my skin feel better immediately! I have yet to try a Cicapair product that I haven’t loved.",2
Absolutely amazing!!!!! The best lip balm ever and believe me I’ve tried EVERYTHING.,2
such an amazing product. If you’re on the fence about purchasing this DO IT. So worth the price tag.,2
This toner and the blueberry bounce cleanser have kept my skin breakout and texture free while still hydrating! Absolutely Love!,2
It feels sooo good on my skin and has a nice cool touch. My combination skin soaked it right up. The cool sensation is so refreshing and I even like the smell. Definitely give this try your skin will feel amazing in the morning.,2
"I was gifted this product gifted by Glow Recipe  to test and I am seriously impressed. I have combination skin and the serum smelled good and made my skin feel smooth and it had a faint pleasant watermelon smell. The packaging is cute and it looks awesome on my vanity. I also have sensitive skin and this product did not make me break out, I felt like I had a nice even glow.",2
Love love love it! It is not heavy but still super hydrating and leaves my skin looking and feeling so soft and smooth! The best part is that the hydration lasts all day,2
"The formula is super light but, potent. It sinks into the skin quickly without leaving a sticky film behind. The turmeric is so soothing on my sensitive skin. The packaging is beyond beautiful and a little goes a long way. One bottle will last a while.",2
"LOVE LOVE LOVE the hydration and moisture from this cream without making me break out!!! What an amazing product. I can’t say enough about this, and I absolutely love this brand. A must have!!!",1
I love this moisturizer. I honestly did not think that I was going to like it that much since it’s for dry skin but I have combination skin and I used this after the shower and the next morning my skin was so soft!! I can’t wait to use this product more. Great buy,2
"Winter is awful on my checks and my acne. I ahve to wash my face for the acne to start subsiding and therefor my checks dry out super easily. What is nice about this product is that it is sensitive enough for your face to not break out, strong enough to refresh dry skin and nourishing enough to spread the extra on your hands.",1
I really wanted to love this product but didn’t. It didn’t minimize pores or refine anything like it avertises. My skin felt momentarily hydrated then dry. I gave it 2 jars worth of trys but couldn’t justify the price and lack of everything! The packaging IS beautiful though.,0
"Tried the mini pack they have. It does have a noticeable scent, however this didnt bother me. I just didnt feel a difference and certainly wouldnt buy it for almost 60$ alone. Ive been testing out this product since like february so its been part of my routine for a while. Was hoping for a better result.",0
"I started using this product when I got it in the Murad Acne Complex Starter Kit. Before this I had been using the Boscia line of products, which I liked in general but the Boscia products just weren’t giving me the results I was looking for. When I switched to the Murad acne line, I noticed results within one week and am pleased with my skin after having used it for 4 months or so. I still get breakouts, but I think my skin is still playing catch up from the face wash that I used for all of 2009 that eventually ruined my skin (a home-made face wash from herbs and spices). My complexion is a lot clearer in general and my pores are noticeably smaller and I’m confident that I’ll have very clear skin in another month or so, thanks to the Murad acne line.",1
"Nice scent, refreshing, balancing out your skin for every season. when you dont know what is the next cleanser to buy, go with this one and you will never be wrong!!",2
I love this product. It feels good on the skin and does not feel greasy after applying. Keeps my face hydrated all day.,2
"As a newly minted 40-year-old, I have found myself feeling a bit blue about my overall skin tone and texture. I was delighted to find that I had been selected to receive this particular sample. At the time, I was searching for a new moisturizer but was not having any success. After just a few days I noticed an improvement in the overall tone of my skin.  My complexion seemed brighter and I started feeling as though I could maybe pull back on the amount of makeup that I used. After a couple of weeks, I noticed that when I did wear makeup that it sat better on my skin. There was a noticeable difference in the amount of creasing of my foundation and there was a definite improvement in the suppleness of my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to visibly improve the tone, texture, and moisture tot heir skin. They wouldn’t be disappointed.",2
"Love this product, great for clearing skin and minimizing fine lines. Would highly recommend for all skin types. I have sensitive skin and this caused no issues.",2
"If I was sent to a deserted island and told I was allowed to bring only one beauty product with me, I’d bring this one, and the palm trees would be blinded by my beauty.  This stuff is magic.  I literally don’t wear foundation anymore, I just put some of this on in the morning with a little translucent powder.  It has somehow reduced my 12-step morning routine to a single step.  My skin even looks better when I’m not wearing it!  It blends seemlessly into my face and covers all redness while somehow keeping me looking natural and makeup-free.  The SPF is just an added bonus to this miracle cream.  If this were ever discontinued, I would sell DR. JART  my firstborn for another jar.  I bought the larger size and in the past six months I’ve only really used about half of it.  This jar of green cream is my most precious possession!",2
"With the warmer weather steadily approaching, I can find my lips feeling a little dry and needing an extra boost. This lip sleeping mask hydrates and softens my lips over night leaving them silky smooth and shiny. Using this all summer long! (though it is great for any season).",2
"This is my first review actually. I have long been a Sephora fan, and have tried many, many creams, from samples and purchases. Everything from La Mer to Fresh, Clinique and Bobbi Brown. I find that value-wise, this cream is great. It is ultra hydrating, not greasy or irritating, and very reasonably priced compared to most other creams. No, it’s not going to change your skin overnight and make you look 10 years younger- but it will hydrate your skin nicely and smoothly.",2
"I have been shopping for a good cleanser for a while and this is by far my FAVORITE!! I feels so good on your face and makes my skin feel so smooth.  In my beauty bag, it is seriously one of my must haves!",2
"I had the pleasure of using this product on my skin. I have purchased from this brand before and their products never fail me! The smell is incredible, the product looks so pretty, and it feels amazing on my sensitive skin. My skin suffers from dryness and dullness but with this product it became more hydrated and vibrant.",2
"The product works very well ! Removes all makeup even my mascara !Sadly I have acne prone skin , I’ve noticed my pores are looking larger and  I stared to break out a little :(",0
very good size very excited to use it. leaves a bit of a sparkly finish,1
"I know it’s supposed to be a gentle exfoliator but it feels like it does absolutely nothing, got it in gratis and am using it beyond generously just to get rid of it. I will stick to my tatcha rice powder, which is the best gentle exfoliant on the market. Do like the smell of this however",0
Wow! Such a luxury silky serum. I’ve been using this for about a week now and my skin feels so smooth. I’ve seen my skin tone evening and clear up,2
received free sample! I liked this product! It made my skin feel very soft instantly after use!,1
"This stuff does wonders to my ends. Towards my next haircut, my ends get really dry and I love these to help moisturize them. Also remember, a little goes a long way!",2
"I really wanted to like this, but it dries out my lips and I just can’t get used to the fragrance.",0
This is a great daily moisturizer and it has help my acne prone skin too. :) I love the anti-inflammatory properties this seems to have and it is light weight and no real oder so it is great for sensitive skin. This is a great product and has done wonders for my eyes too. Thanks you Josie for giving us something so pure and simple.,2
"I received the Origins GinZing moisturizer complimentary from an Influenster VoxBox, and I have been loving the boost it gives my skin every morning. I love the scent and it is light and moisturizing, and great for my combination skin. I definitely will purchase this in the future.",2
It’s a very okay eye cream. I wouldn’t say I’m obsessed with it but it’s good for the affordable price.,1
haven’t noticed a huge difference but it’s not terrible .,1
Love this essence. My skin is smooth and feels great.,2
Was pleasantly surprised by this moisturizer - it’s great for someone with dry skin. I layer it with my nars tinted moisturizer and it’s kept my face feeling comfortable for the last month or so despite the winter chill.,2
"I’ve been resisting trying this for so long because I was afraid I would love it, and be hooked to such a pricey product. I finally tried it and was not impressed. First, it STINKS! How come no one mentions it smells so bad? It doesn’t not make me happy to put it on, because of the smell. In terms of effectiveness, I did not notice a drastic difference in my skin compared to other similar products that are a fraction of the price.",1
Leaves skin feeling super soft and fresh! I love this product and its really helpful in the winter when my face is dryer than usual. I would definitely buy it again in the bigger size!,2
I use this once a week when I do my weekly facial. It leaves my face feeling sooo soft and the glow lasts the whole week. My boyfriend even said “wow your skin looks amazing”. I bought this on a whim because I saw Julia Havens using it and I’m so glad I did! I’ve used Lancer The Method Polish for YEARS and I will never buy it again as long as this product exists. It works 1000x better for less than half the price. Amazing. 10/10. Just buy it,2
I have mild to moderate exzema and this doesn’t irritate my skin at all. Also works great with my clarisonic!,1
I have normal to dry skin with occasional acne. I like this oil as a spot treatment to help decrease inflammation. I did not notice that it helped clear blackheads. It’s also a very thick oil that has a tendency to sit on the skin so I mix it with a dry oil like murula oil to help it absorb into the skin faster.,1
"I honestly can’t tell if this is making a difference or if my whole skincare routine is just better in general. But overall, I think it’s a good cleanser and have continued to use it for at least the last year.",1
I see why everyone loves this so much! I can use it on the day or night as a sleep mask either way it’s so moisturizing! Doesn’t feel sticky in my opinion and leaves the skin looking so glowy! Will repurchase again and again.,2
I have super sensitive skin and very dry lips. All lip balms cause me to break out around my lip line. This is the only one that smoothes my lips and doesn’t cause me to break out. I can even wear lips color again!!,2
"This came out of the tube looking super orange, but upon applying it on my skin it looks alright. Blends well, but the pump gives you wayyyy too much. Half a pump is typically more than enough for me. Doesn’t make me look oily or crease during the day",1
"I’m glad it’s mostly natural ingredients, and my experience was positive (user experience - felt and smelled nice), but I didn’t notice a difference in my skin.",1
"I love that I can use this and not need foundation as well, for my everyday look. it has a nice dewy finish and conceals my redness and enlarged pores",1
this balm is fab!! I bought it on my last visit 2 Sephora I was about 2 pay when I saw it! it smells delicious! n it really hidratate lips besides the I lob the presentatation is so me!,2
"Pros: glowy finish, sinks in quickly, no tacky feel, no white castCons: can pill on top of skincare and under makeup, for the price i won’t repurchase because of this",1
"I received a sample complimentary from Influenster. I haven’t used Estée Lauder skin care in the past but have always heard amazing stuff so I was very excited to try this. Just had a baby so my skin is all sorts of unhappy, mostly changing from plump, slightly oily to very dry, sebum filling my pores, some cystic acne and needing to exfoliate every day. I used a tiny bit of this product after cleansing and I liked how my skin felt. A very slight tingle but my skin felt entirely moisturized, which typically with a serum or I should say- if I’m not using a thick/heavy cream, my skin feels blah, dry and tight. I haven’t noticed other benefits yet, I don’t have fine lines or wrinkles but I will keep using and see what it does. So far very happy.",1
Lathers good and my face feels clean. I have sensitive skin and I’m very leery of putting anything on my skin. Being that this was a clean brand I gave it a try. I’m glad I did. I love it.,1
"I’ve received this product as a trail size in the birthday sample kit. My skin is on the dry side. I’ve also been introducing retinal to my skin care regimen which adds on to the dryness. I’ve tried 3 different kinds of moisturizers (farmacy, laneige, drmtlgy) they was not hydrating enough. I’ve also tried Clinique dramatically hydrating jelly and cerave which seems to help somewhat. With this cream being my last resort, I’ve tried it and it just soaked into my skin and my skin felt incredibility hydrating. It has been months since my skin felt completely hydrated. It does leave a super dewy look. A little really does go a long way. I feel like too much can contribute to pore clogging which I haven’t experienced.  It looks well under my skin tint moisturizer but 1st allow this to settled into your skin before make up application. The reason why I removed a star is because I am not a fan of jar packing (although the packing is absolutely stunning), I do not like the the last 5 irritating ingredients at the bottom of list (listed on the packaging and tatcha website) which are: alcohol, fragrance, citral, limonene, and linalool. Although these ingredients do not irritated my skin personally, but overtime with repeated usage, I do not know what kind of affects this will have on my skin. The fragrance is light and has a spa like smell. It is not overpowering and it do not linger. However the facial wash is quite strong. I’ve purchased this full size and will continue to use until otherwise my skin dislikes it.",1
I wasted 100 points on this. It smells Aweful like cinnamon (why would you want cinnamon on your face?!) And is very overpowering. When I used it I broke out horribly (and I rarely break out) it left my face bright red and irritated. I would NEVER but our spend this kind of money on this. Horrible product!,0
The best product ever!,2
"This moisturizer is amazing for people who can tolerate a thick moisturizer. I have very dry sensitive skin, prone to acne and unfortunately I was noticing my skin breaking out. Sadly, it was because this product is very rich in shea butter and other ingredients which clogged my pores. I wanted to love it!!! This is still an amazing moisturizer if your skin can handle it.",1
"I really love this product, my face feels really soft and looks very glowing :)",2
Got the Mini Birthday Set and definitely going to be investing in the full sizes! so hydrating! And not too heavy I also haven’t had any breakouts annnddd was friendly to the psoriasis on my face :) :),2
I love the smell and the way it feels. I use it in the morning and love it!,2
"I was so intrigued when I saw Avocado Melt Retinol Sleeping Mask. As a skincare junkie I have tried just about every high end luxury cream and have never found one that doe sit all. Until now, this stuff legitimately does it all. It has helped with my dark circles, puffiness, fine lines, brightening, ect. I love the creamy light but hydrating texture that melts into the skin. Despite having sensitive eyes it has not made bothered my eyes and I apply 360 degrees around my eyes. The packaging is so cute with the little glass jar and the spatula that comes with it. The eye mask is a standard 15ml though it does not look like alot it will last for months considering you only need 3 little rice size dots on each eye. The price is also affordable for a eye cream that actually works. I am on cloud 9 with this product and absolutely recommend trying it!",2
I could feel the hydration instantly when I put this on my face. I have oily skin and this absorbed very quickly and didn’t leave me feeling sticky. Very impressed and it smells great too!,2
"I’ve used this scrub for 20+ years... have tried others, but always come back to this one. It is reasonablly priced and leaves my face feeling great!",2
"I’ve had my jar for over a year now. It smells great and the jar lasts a long time BUT overall I do NOT like this product. I will keep using it here and there because I have it but I would not rebuy and would not recommend. I used this as intended ... at night before I go to sleep as an overnight lip mask. For some reason this does not soak into my lips. In the morning my lips don’t feel hydrated or moisturized but instead I still feel the product sitting on top of my lips. It is weird I know, but it just doesn’t soak into my lips. I personally see no difference in my lips when using it. Now instead of only using this at night as a lip mask, I am wanting to use it up (because I paid for it and to get it out of my collection) by putting a light layer on throughout the day as well. Will not repurchase when I’m done.",0
"This is one of the best absorbing sunscreens I have ever used!! It does not leave you with that sticky or tacky feeling that other sunscreens do, and I’ve had no issues using this on both my face and body.",2
"Okay so I’m actually shocked at how much I love this product. I’ve been trying to be very careful about what I put on my skin after some recent irritation and was wary about trying a new brand but this was SO GOOD. I’ve been taking probiotic supplements but didn’t even know they could be applied externally as well. I was floored by how soft and smooth my skin was when I woke up, and there was NO irritation. I am seriously considering purchasing the full size.",2
"Really love this stuff! It makes my skin feel so nice and soft, it hydrates it nicely too as I have semi dry skin, especially in the winter. The packaging is beautiful, the bottle looks so nice on the makeup dresser. The smell to me isn’t overwhelming, and I love to shake the bottle to watch it get all bubbly or sparkly.Will definitely be buying this product again when I run out!!",1
"I was incentivized with a sample of this product from Influenster in return for my honest opinion. Obviously, since it was a sample size, I can’t assess long term results, but I can say that from the first time I used it, my skin felt noticeably softer and smoother than it had with my previous moisturizer. I’m very pleased with the immediate results and they certainly would seem to indicate that long term use would show even more improvement in my skin.",2
"This exfoliator produces excellent results -- my face is very clean and soft after using it, and it’s not overly dry either. I’m willing to pay the (high) price for using this once weekly to help keep my skin clear, but I did have to deduct one star because, unfortunately, it does burn occasionally. It usually just tingles, but you do have to be careful while using it. I usually leave it on for a little less time than recommended, and I wash it off with cool water to soothe the tingling. You might think I’m crazy for keeping a product that occasionally hurts when you use it, but it works so well that it’s worth it!",1
"I absolutely love this eye cream. It is very light, feels good when applying it, and while I haven’t noticed any changes yet, I will definitely continue using the product.",2
Best face wash in the game. Lathers so well and gets all makeup off. Actually look forward to washing my face with this!!,2
"This is my favorite product ever! I use it day and night no matter what! I even wear it over my lipsticks and under of the lipstick is too dark. I have used everything you can think of to hydrate my lips and this one takes the cake ! And doesn’t smell or taste bad, very mellow nice smell.",2
"HOLY BLEMISH TREATMENT, BATMAN!!  A dab of this stuff on your zit before bed and that sucker will be gone (or almost gone) by morning.   I say almost gone because I had this HUGE blemish on my chin (thanks Aunt Flow) and it did take 2 nights/treatments to clear... But all my other average sized pimples are gone overnight with this miracle elixir.  I even have my husband using it (and he just isn’t into all this floofy skin care stuff)",2
"This stuff is the BOMB!! I love the way it smells, the way it feels on my face and the way my face still feels and looks the next morning! I use it in combination with the scrub and the eye cream and they are all amazing. I received this product from influenster to try for free and give my unbiased review.",2
I’m on my 3rd bottle of this. It smells so yummy and feels so silky and light when I apply it. Every Sunday night I do the DE Babyfacial before bed and it’s pretty rough on the skin and then I apply this moisturizer and it soaks right in. Then I use the matching sleep mask and wake up Monday morning with soft radiant silky skin.,1
"I don’t normally post reviews but I have tried so many moisturizers and this is ultimately my go to. I don’t think I will ever use a different moisturizer. I have combo/dry skin and it makes the world of a difference. My skin looks and feels better, and my makeup goes on much smoother! This pairs really well with the Tatcha deep cleanse as well. Overall, I will definitely be repurchasing!",2
I love the smell. The packaging. I’m allergic to most makeup remover wipes. Not these. They work. No retinol. That’s a good thing for me.,2
Best cleanser ever! It smells amazing and I noticed I am getting less acne especially during PMS. I like how gentle it is and leaves my skin extremely soft.,2
"The cleanser I have been searching for. Literally changed my life. I have tried too many cleansers to count for “sensitive skin.” Yet some how I still break out. I Typically have dry, moderate acne prone skin with redness. It’s been a few months now and all of those problems are gone. I will never use a different cleanser again.",2
I received Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel from PinchMe as a free sample. I had never tried a peel before and was excited to give it a shot. I love it. My skin is free of flakes and smooth.,1
"I received this product free from Influenster. Sometimes I tend to shy away from toners because my skin is so sensitive!!! I actually did like this toner, it’s not drying and it helps With my acne scars. The only place I got irritation is if I already had previously inflamed hormonal acne. So I think it’s great if you steer clear from those areas of your skin :) I love doing it especially around my nose!! This is the biggest difference I’ve noticed!",1
"Super hydrating, great used in conjunction with the tumeric mask.",2
I love this product super hydrating leave my skin super smooth,2
Used this in the morning and I love how it woke up my skin. Skin felt refreshed and soft afterwards. It was gentle on my skin yet felt like it was really exfoliating. I will add this to my morning routine a few times a week.,2
"A lady at Sephora gave me about 5 pads as a sample to use at home, and I loved it! It really does its job.",2
"I’m a big fan if cleansing oils, and this balm is average at best. It took a lot of it to remove waterproof makeup of any kind, and it doesn’t rince off as completely as I’d like. I’m sticking to liquid in the future!",1
I recently received this product complimentary for testing purposes and I am beyond grateful. I have very oily skin and moisturizer is a product I have a hard time with. Hydra Zen goes on thick and dries without any type of film- my shiny skin has been taking until at least noon to arrive nowadays. Thanks for this awesome product!,1
"I’m really happy with this, so far. I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin feels great! I have really sensitive skin so I am really apprehensive about new products especially exfoliating.",2
I have been searching for a scrub like thism especially one that doesn’t tear my face up like most do. This smells divine as well as cleans my face and has even cleared my complexion. I am infatuated with this scrub.,2
Love it! Have used it for years and have no desire to use anything else.,2
"I have been using this product since I started college and it has been the key to fully cleansing my skin. This will really get everything off of your skin (I love makeup!) but still keep it balanced. I have tried Purity Made Simple and so many others, but none compare. I recommend to everyone!",2
"To be honest, sunblock has never been part of my skin care. I never realize how important it is to use until now. So I wanted to give this brand a try because i heard so many good things about it. And WOW , absolutely LOVE!!!! No white cast, leaves my face hydrated and glowing. 100% recommend!",2
"Exactly as advertised, makes your skin dewy glowing. At least worked for me anyway.",2
Miracle product for my dry/sensitive skin. Takes all my makeup and spf off without being overly stripping and overly drying. Honestly the best makeup remover I’ve ever tried that hasn’t irritated my skin. If you’re looking for a wintertime cleanser this is perfect.,2
I took off a star for being so expensive but omg I wish I didn’t love this so much because it hurts buying it every month. But omfg this stuff is amazing.,1
"Best Product EVER. This incredible product melts away every trace of makeup, even waterproof, and leaves your skin soft, moisturized and super hydrated. Even does great on my oily skin.",2
"Great treatment but very expensive, these one will last for 4-6 months using 2 a day.  Its worth it you are a ritual person and want to spent little bit more money",1
"I love this moisturizer. I use it before bed at night mixed with the TLC Framboos serum and my skin has never felt so hydrated and soft in the morning! I’ve tried several moisturizers and serums and this moisturizer is amazing. My skin loves it and it hasn’t broken me out or caused irritation, and I have sensitive skin. I also like the packaging and how it gives you just the right amount.",2
"I wanted this to work so badly and it did, but unfortunately while I slept it transferred to the skin around my mouth and caused ugly mouth breakouts. Not a good look! If you are not prone to break outs, use this because it works! Live the life I cannot live",1
This serum feels nice and light weight on the skin I don’t really see any differences in my skin since starting to use this product but that may just be because I’ve only been using it 2 weeks,1
"This is the first retinol I tried, and I’m sticking to it. A little goes a long way, and after using this consistently for the past 5 months, I’ve definitely noticed a difference in the tone and texture of my skin. Adding this to my routine has helped me feel more confident in makeup-free skin. A few weeks in, there was some flaking and dryness, which is expected when starting with retinol, but it went away within a week or 2. Stick with it, and use the 1 - 2 - 3 rule for the first few weeks!I tried the Olay Regenerist retinol for a month to see if I could get away with a cheaper retinol, but I definitely noticed a difference in efficacy and went back to DE before I finished the Olay.",1
Amazing moisturizer. It is non sticky and keeps my skin hydrated for a long time. I apply it twice a day. my skin has started glowing. also the smell is very mild and subtle.. plus the bottle has pump so no need to touch the cream.. love this product. I shall definitely keep using this!!!!,2
"My boyfriend walked in yesterday and the first thing he said to me was “WOW your skin is glowing!“I received this product for Christmas and have been using it every night as my first step cleanser. After having multiple dermatologists mistake my dehydrated skin as oily skin, and giving me the wrong products to use I now have a lot of blackheads as well as acne scarring and hyperpigmentation. I have been using exfoliating products for the last year in an effort to get rid of my blackheads and clogged pores. After hearing about this enzyme cleansing balm and reading reviews I decided I wanted to try it and add it to my routine.First off I love the fruity refreshing smell. It does dissipate so if you’re concerned about a strong fragrance I wouldn’t let that deter you. It’s a very creamy balm consistency. I haven’t had any issues with it being runny or needing to be mixed like some other reviews have said so maybe that is a storing issue. It spreads on the skin really nicely and does a good job of removing makeup as my step one cleanser. To be fair I do not use foundation and only do eye makeup and lipstick. It rinses off better than other balm cleansers that I have used and leaves my skin really smooth. My skin feels so nice after I almost don’t want to do my step two cleanser.Being as I have only been using it a couple weeks, it’s hard to tell if it’s impacting my blackheads since they are so old and deep. But it is worth noting that the last pore strip I used seemed to pull out a lot more debris from my skin so maybe that is because of this cleanser.It only takes a small amount of product to cleanse my face so this jar is going to last me quite a while.It’s a bit more expensive than the last balm that I used but smells better, works better and takes less product to cleanse so in the long run I think it will actually be cheaper. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a step one cleanser.",2
Love the product will recommend . Felt very smooth n nice for the first time to use it .,2
These are really good. They are really sticky and they stay in place all night. Only downside is the price. They are a bit expensive for the number you get but they work very well.,1
Love this moisturizer! I use it at night and I wake up with my face feeling super hydrated. The only criticism is with the metal tube… the lotion keeps coming out after you squeeze out the amount of lotion you want. So there is a little learning curve with it. But the product is great!,2
Love this product! I’ve repurchased this twice now and I don’t think I’ll ever go back to another cleanser. It’s so gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean but not overly dry!,2
"I had previously purchased the Minted Rose balm in a tin and love it. So obviously I was excited that there was a tube form available. I love the tube, the formula works like a champ, but the rose scent seems really strong. It was like putting perfume on my mouth. Sad, I really wanted to like this.",0
Was hesitant b/c I have combination skin-not oily at all-made my skin smooth and clear and di not aggravate blemishes. Even use in my hair & on my elbows. A multi-tasking product that I am pleased with.,2
"Used a sample of this and after just that one night was pretty amazed at the results. My skin looked SO young and plumped, elasticity boosted to the max, hydrated, glowing. It was surprising. I’m 26 - I didn’t think my skin needed to / could look younger. Only downside is that it felt like it sealed off my pores and made me break out a little bit (though my skin is already acne prone). Recommended it to my mom. Hope this is still around when I’m older and really need a good anti-aging product.",2
I have very dry skin and this smooths out all my lines and keeps my skin hydrated all day & night. Ive been obsessed with this product since I first tried to mini as a free gift. Just a little goes a long way!!,2
"I have very oily skin, and it has been that way since I was a teenager. I have tried ever scrub on the market from drug stores to more expensive lines, and really this is one I will use for a long time because it feels like it is working. For some it may be strong, but my skin needs it. I am not sure about all the claims it makes of reducing wrinkles/lines and deflaking skin, but it does feel like it is smoothing my skin. It is not too expensive for how much you need, and I use it every morning and night. I think it is worth the cost because you only need a little. Give it a try!",1
This is the best eye cream I have ever tried! My skin felt so hydrated and I noticed my under eyes looked more rejuvenated. The cream is so moisturizing and feels luxurious,2
"This is most certainly not for pale skin or people sensitive to scents. Color is green, immediately upon opening the scent is strong. The color does shift to an orangey-beige after rubbing it in and somehow the red undertones still poked through. I’m glad I purchased the small size and will be able to return it but this is not made for people who are in the pale to fair skin categories.",0
I love this stuff. I wear it everyday. I am on my second bottle. It makes my face feel really soft.,2
Amazing product. Love the feel of this on my skin. Also serves as a great primer! This is my 3rd bottle!,2
I really wanted to love this product! But it broke me out terribly. Every morning after I would use this product I would have a new cystic zit! I kept giving it chances but I finally had to return because my face just couldn’t handle it. It smells nice though!,0
"I wanted to be one of those the ones that adores this, unfortunately it did not work for me :(.  After a few weeks of using this, i noticed more clogged pores than i already had on my face (black and whiteheads).  I had a red spot on my chest, used it on that as well in hope of fading it quicker and i ended up getting a few blackheads there too after a few weeks of using which i never had before so i knew it was this product that caused it.  I’m super sad and bummed that this doesn’t work wonders on me like how it does for others.",0
"I received a sample of this at Sephora and noticed a marked difference in my skin while using it. This past summer, I guess the humidity made my combination skin super oily and I had horrible closed comedones all over my face, to the point where I didn’t want to leave the house. Fast forward a few months and I have switched up a few products in my routine, but I have to say this has been the biggest game changer for me. I noticed an improvement within a few days of using it again. I use it once a day in the evening and my skin is now smooth and more even toned. I feel confident leaving the house without makeup. I hope Sunday Riley never stops making this! This is worth every penny, my t-zone hasn’t looked this clear in a long time!",2
These are the worst acne patches I have ever used. They do not stick even for a few seconds,0
"Great Product! Love the different amount of ways it can work, such as for my makeup look or just to moisturize my lips. Love the fact how it’s so natural and no chemicals. Great product, definitely worth it and such a great price!",2
"wow, i love this product--it works so well around the eyes and hydrates it. but holy batsh*t, i just looked at the ingredients! it’s brim filled with a variety of parabens, sulfates, and other bad ingredients, including propylene glycol and the neurotoxin phenoxyethanol. i bought this thinking that kiehl’s was a into natural and green ingredients. never again.",0
"I received this product for free to review on Influenster. This product does not smell very strong, although it has a light sunblock-like scent to me. It is a light, liquid substance that you apply during your daily facial cleansing routine. Over time, I did not notice a very big difference when adding this item into my routine, however, there was a small change that made my skin look slightly more dewy. I do not have facial wrinkles or uneven skin tone, so I cannot comment on that. Overall, I do like and recommend this product, but those who live in humid environments should take caution, as it can feel a little sticky on your face during that kind of weather.",1
"I wanted to love this, I love the soy cleanser and I love most of fresh’s products but this completely irritated my skin. My skin was left red and raw for over 24 hours. I was gifted this product by Influenster and I was so, so , so excited to try it. I have combination skin more on the oily side during spring/summer so I was shocked. I’d give it a good test patch on your hand prior to using on your face if you have any sensitivity issues.",0
I don’t usually write reviews but this product was awful! At first when you try it it feels nice on the skin but once it comes time to washing it up it is such a terrible experience. It not only dried out my face but also my hands. I have combo to oily skin so when I say dry it was DRY! My skin was like squeaky clean and uncomfortable. I usually love Origins but I HATED this product.,0
"Um, I don’t know what to say, this product is weird. Too much hassle to apply it and shake it off your face after. It’s rather annoying than anything. I didn’t notice any miraculous effect either ",0
"I received this product as a free sample about a month ago and wanted to give it a fair run before writing a review on it, I wanted to be as honest as possible. With most skin care products, I go in with very high expectations because I figure by now these companies should have the proper science, technology and ingredients to make products that work. This entire line impressed me. The facial cleanser has a very refreshing, minty sensation when being massaged into the skin, I love that. It washes off like a dream without making my skin feel to dry or tight. I will continue using this face wash. It’s pretty great!",2
"Coming from someone who doubted this product for months - I could not be more obsessed! I’m the person who has a chapstick at all times because my lips stay chapped. Since using this, I barely need my chapstick anymore! I put it on at night and in the morning. I swear it has made my lips more plump! It’s totally worth the money IMO. It even comes with a cute applicator. If you’re on the fence, just do it!!",2
"I’ve been using Honeymoon Glow for about six months now and it’s going to stay in my regimen. I use it 1-2 times a week at bedtime after cleansing and I add Farmacy’s Honey halo on top after a few minutes. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels smoother, looks hydrated and plumper and feels like it’s glowing. Highly recommend and a little goes a long way so a bottle will last a while.",2
"One of my friends recommended this face wash and I am so glad that she did! I love it. It leaves my skin feeling very clean, but doesn’t make it feel super dry. I actually look forward to using this face wash!",1
Works great. Sheer w/just a hint of color,1
I have very dry skin and this was so moisturizing for me I only used it nightly. Skin is very soft and healthy looking. No dry patches that I normally didn’t. I didn’t notice much of a difference in my fine lines but was so please with the moisture I would repurchase.,2
Love it! Nicely cleanses without drying out.  Skin feels so clean.  Thank you.,2
"I just want to start this review off with saying that I’ve tried tons of masks - natural and synthetic - and none work as good as this one. I find I’m either allergic to masks, they make me break out, they dry my skin out, or they do nothing. This mask is not like any of them.I bought it about a month ago, I use it once a week and I already see results. I find that the day after I use it, so far every time other than today (I used it last night), I have a couple of pimples more than before.. BUT it’s not like you think. I am a big pimple picker and I’ve been trying to stop because it can be really hard on your skin, but I do continue to pick the pimples that are hard and have a head to them. I find that this mask brings those to the surface without them getting infected... so I don’t have big red zits, but little pimples that just make my pores look bigger. It’s hard to explain, but I feel like my skin is improving. Now that I’ve been using it for about a month, I’ve been noticing the little pore pimples are becoming less and less now too.I love the days that I get to use my mask. I take a hot cloth and put it on my face until I feel that my skin is ready. Then I apply the mask to my face and neck and relax until it dries. At first the mask feels really tingly and nice, then it just dries like anything else.. It tightens but doesn’t flake up too much. It will crack if you move your face though. Once it dries, I have a shower and rinse it all off (much easier in the shower!)...Pros:-It feels nice on my sensitive skin-It makes my skin feel and look clean-Minimizes pores and impurities-Reduces redness-Smells really good (reminds me of cinnamon and oatmeal)Cons:-I find it hard to rinse off unless I’m in the shower",2
I have used this product in the past but didn’t like the dropper aspect of it so I switched. I was so excited to see that they switched to a pump and knew it was going to be a staple for me once again. The formula is amazing soaks right in and gives my skin a brighter appearance. I have sensitive skin and this vegan formula has not caused any irritation. I was gifted by Algenist.,2
"Wow! It left my skin feeling hydrated, refreshed, and soft without feeling oily or greasy!",2
"One of the best exfoliating treatments on the market! I have combination skin and struggle with clogged pores and uneven skin texture, so I’ve tried A LOT of exfoliants over the past few years. This product is amazing and did exactly what it promised to do. I saw my skin looking a lot more smooth and radiant even after the first few uses. The pores a little less visible and i didn’t get any new bumps on my skin. I must say that this treatment might be a bit harsh for dry/sensitive skin, but works wonders for combo/oily skin types. If you struggle with the same issues as me - I’d highly recommend to give this product a try!",2
This is a pretty cool product! The lavender color and scent are so fun! I apply it daily with my AM skincare routine and I noticed my makeup goes on a lot smoother. My skin absorbs this product quickly and doesn’t leave it sticky or heavy feeling. I don’t think I have used it enough to see a big difference in lines and wrinkles but I like what it has been doing for my skin the past few days. I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.,1
"Love this stuff! It’s great for my rosacea combination skin (oily in summer, extremely dry in winter). Leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, and not stripped. It’s pretty hydrating for a cleanser. I live in Michigan so we have cold and very dry winters, making this the perfect cleanser for me. Definitely would recommend!",2
"I got this because I was on a budget and couldn’t exactly afford my usual moisturizer. I should have just waited instead of settling for this. Not only did it break me out, it made me so oily. My skin did not absorb any of this cream, it just sat on my face, and it felt uncomfortable too.",0
"I received this product complimentary from Farmacy Beauty. This is my first product I’ve tried from this brand. I love the light-weight texture of this gel-cream - perfect for the upcoming warmer months. This formula instantly absorbs into my skin, leaving a soft and plump complexion. I really enjoy this moisturizer and it will be a staple part of my skincare regimen this spring/summer!",2
"Done with my 3rd bottle. Very refreshing and hydrating. Great for sensitive skin. I have combination skin, and some breakout. After applying, my skin felt relaxing. I use it when I don’t put on makeup as well.",2
"The 15% Glycolic Acid Overnight Glow Peel from Goopglow was a new experience for me. I have never used an overnight treatment of any kind, let alone one with glycolic acid, so I was skeptical going into testing. The dual textured peel pad is unlike anything I’ve tried before but it wasn’t difficult to use – It has an exfoliating side which I would go easier on if you have sensitive skin or are prone to redness. There is also a slight chemical smell to the product but the tropical fruit ingredients help to balance it out - The kakadu plum also provides antioxidant support while the mango, banana + yellow mombin help to add moisture! When first applying the glow peel it stings a bit, but that went away after a few minutes. After application the product left behind was a little sticky, which did bother me as I was trying to sleep. But when I woke up I peeled off the product as instructed and was delighted to find my face was softer, brighter, and smoother! It gave me a such a beautiful, luminous glow ♡ After using I was definitely considering repurchasing but at $45 for 4 treatments, it might not be the first thing on my list to buy.",2
I received this complimentary from Influenster. I use this at night. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling soft in the morning. I like the clean smell. I haven’t noticed a huge difference in skin texture but will continue to use.,1
"The best cleanser I’ve ever used. I have oily/combo acne prone skin. This helps clear my hormonal breakouts, without stripping my skin. It has a nice scent and minty cool feeling. I’ve tried drugstore to high end acne products, and this along with the Mario Badescu spot treatment has worked the best for me. Product will last a long time. Would recommend for anyone struggling with acne.",2
"I absolutely love this hydration cream! I normally don’t buy any kind of moisturizers or lotions just because I have combination skin that is more on the oily side, but this winter has really dried my cheeks out. This cream was super hydrating in the dry areas but didn’t make the oily areas in my t-zone even oilier. I also have super sensitive skin and this product didn’t irritate it one bit. I highly recommend this product!",2
Love this stuff. Best exfoliating cream ive ever had. Worth the money.,2
"This product glides on smooth, using it nightly leaves my face so soft in the morning, it also has brightened my face. Such a great product, definitely a great addition to my beauty arsenal!!",2
"I love this salve and I was so happy to see it in a tube. For me , the tube is alot more reasonable than the little tin. It’s just my preference. Same great product!",2
"I love this product! As it says, it melts away the make up and very easy to use. I bought this twice already!",1
"Love this product so much! I didn’t realize how much it was actually doing for my skin until unexpectedly running out and having to be without it for a few days. Makes my skin smooth, hydrated, and happy.",2
The Rose & Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Moisturizer Reformulation works amazing on my oily skin. I love that it absorbs very well and has a slight rose scent. It leaves my skin so soft and hydrated. Highly recommended,2
"Seriously in love with this product!! I wish I knew about it sooner so I could have been using it longer! Let my face looking fresh, bright and smooth!",2
"Literally the best cleanser I have ever used. Feels clean, hydrating and smells fresh",2
"I love this stuff! This cream is for dry skin, but I have combination skin. Because I am on tretinoin, I occasionally have small dry patches. This, better than any other moisturizer [including Dr Jart’s Ceramidin (sp?) cream], corrects those within a day. Also, because I have a rather oily forehead, I don’t always put it within an inch or so of my hairline or I get really oily there. But that’s my only consideration when I’m putting this on my face at night. During the day I use a different moisturizer that isn’t quite as emollient. I am so happy I tried this stuff, which I did after watching a Doctorly episode on YouTube. I started out with the mini and almost immediately got the 3 oz size because I don’t want to be without it. Worth every penny!",2
Awesome cleanser. I had acne my entire life and nothing else has worked so well like this product. Cleans and minimizes my pores. Eliminates redness. I’ve been using it for 4 years!,1
I initially loved this product as it left my skin perfectly glowy. I quickly realized though that it would also cause a breakout every time I used it which was unfortunate. My skin is a bit sensitive so maybe others would have better luck.,0
"Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream with Squalane is amazing compared to other facial creams I tried. Other creams left my face feeling oily and my pores clogged. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream with Squalane was light weight and provided a long lasting moisture for my face giving my skin a beautiful glow. In addition to the all day moisture and beautiful glow, Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream with Squalane made my skin really soft and worked amazing on my eczema dry spots. I recommend Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream with Squalane for women of all ages whether you’re young and want to maintain your healthy skin or older and looking to get your vibrant glow back. Definitely going to stock up on this facial cream.",2
Love this product! I have sensitive skin and this has helped clear me acne when very few products worked. I saw results after a little as two days. This brand has become a staple in my skin routine after this!,2
"I’ve been using Luna for about 3 years.  The months I’ve gone w/o using Luna (while trying out other serums) I’ve seen and felt the difference in my skin.  My skin feels hydrated, luminous and CALM.  I use Luna at night after using an exfoliating toner, and the two combined are magic.  Layering Good Genes over Luna (I do this only when I can Afford both) is INCREDIBLE.  3-4 drops goes a long way! An entire bottle lasts a little over a year.",2
"I love how this cleansing oil melts off all my makeup & impurities before I use my exfoliating cleanser. It’s an oil, but leaves your face feeling clean & not greasy.",2
"I use the glycolic polish on Sunday, Exfolikate on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I have broken out with bumps on my forehead and chin. I have used the products for 2 weeks now. I wonder if all the “gunk“ is being brought up to the surface (my face is normally smooth and clear), or IF the products just don’t agree with my skin? Well, I am going to only Exfolikate once a week now and see what happens. Ugh! (And YES, I followed the directions EXACTLY with both products).",0
"I love this product. I first tried it as a sample and LOVED how light it felt as a primer so I went back and bought it. I pair it with Urban Decay Naked foundation and it feels as if I have no makeup on! Smells good, keeps my skin smooth and moisturizes well while keeping the light feel. You don’t have to use a lot of product to get good coverage. So far, loving it!!",2
"I’ve been using this product for four days and it has immediately made a huge difference in how my face looks. Like whoa made a difference—my husband asked me why my face looked so young today HA!  But seriously... my pores are almost nonexistent, my skin is much firmer and very tight, it looks like I’m glowing, and my face is so much brighter. I’ve been using an acid toner for a while, so the extra strength was not too much for me, but it does sting a bit. I hope they never stop making this.",2
"#giftedbyfresh - this serum is absolutely incredible! It has this beautiful milky texture that absorbs beautifully into the skin, leaving behind calmed soft skin. With an all star ingredients list that didn’t irritate my sensitive skin - this serum is a dream. Absolute must have.",2
Great sleeping lip mask.Super hydrating and get a lot of product for the price.,1
"I really like this moisturizer, super lightweight and provides a great base. I tend to have dry skin with the exception of Summer, which I can get more oily/sweaty. This texture is perfect for the season, and you don’t need a whole lot of product. I’ve seen some complaints about the smell but I feel like it’s light and slightly earthy/natural, so I prefer this smell to some of the scents of other moisturizers. Definitely worth a sample from the store if you can.",2
Got a small bottle as a reward and wow! It’s so creamy and well hydrating. You wake up the next morning and your skin is very hydrated. Worth it!,2
"it’s my favorite cleanser that i’ve ever tried and will definitely repurchase in the future. it smells good, feels soft while applying, and makes my skin feel great (plus it doesn’t leave a sticky feeling on my skin like a lot of other cleansers i’ve tried). the only issue i have is that i don’t get a pump with the mini size so it’s a bit difficult to get out, but that is something that can be solved by buying the full size which i will in the future.",2
Hands down my favorite new moisturizer! My skin feels so hydrated after every use and doesn’t feel so greasy. I can put this under my daily foundation or use with no makeup for a daily glow. Highly recommend!,2
"I bought this product for my pimples after developing quite the acne spot from constant use of masks and especially the humidity and sweatiness while wearing them in the summer. I would best describe my skin as: quite sensitive, oily on the T-zone (especially my nose), normal every where else, pimple prone on the outer cheeks and a bit every where else, has discolouration, around mouth and chin, doesn’t tolerate a lot of product and a lot of steps, may be dehydrated.I would say this if I had to describe the product and it’s effects on me: a daily exfoliating and repairing treatment that penetrates the skin and helps accelerate the natural cell turnover of my skin, deeply cleans pores, reduces and stables oil production and leaves my skin more radiant and even looking. How I use this product at night: I double cleanse with an oil based cleanser, wipe my face dry, apply step 1, wait 2 min, apply step 2, wait 2 min, apply moisturizer. The product does sting a little bit and may make your face more red for a min and pimples more apparent when applying, but the redness of the pimples should go down after a nights rest. Now I will say this, this is in no way a miracle product (though it impresses me quite a bit), you have to be consistent and keep using it for your pimples to go down and keep buying it again. In no way will it clear your skin after 1-2 weeks of use that is just asking for the impossible (I use them every other day). Take your budget into account, because it is quite expensive. You may be looking at a 6 weeks+ for clearing skin and really getting the full effect (and it depends on your acne and skin condition) look at it realistically and you won’t be let down.  A money saving tip is to cut the product in half and seal the rest (half is enough trust me) I cannot recommend this product as every skin is different and you know best what fits it, but I would say to try the 5 packs to see what strength is good for you.",1
"Took make up and left skin feeling good, but caused major breakouts.",0
"This is a really nice cream. It’s lightweight, creamy, fast absorbing, and makes my skin look radiant and soft. The packaging is also super cute! But I just can’t give it 5 stars, because I find the price is too expensive.",1
I got this as a freebie from influenster. Love the texture and overall feel! It’s amazing on my skin- my only negative is the price Which is a bit high for my liking but worth the investment!,1
"I really love this product. I’ve never used a Retinol cream before and I wasn’t sure what to expect but it does just what I was hoping it would. In a little over a week, it smoothed out most of my texture and gotten rid of all of the stubborn little whiteheads on my forehead. I have very sensitive combo skin (oily t-zone and dry cheeks and chin) and almost anything can upset it. I’m usually very hesitant to introduce a new product into my routine but DE has never steered me wrong in the past and I’m happy I took a chance with this one. I haven’t had any issues with breakouts and I use it about 3 times a week mixed with Lala and B-Hydra. If the results continue this way, this will be a staple for me.",2
really moisturizing and smells like sugar cookies!!! plus it’s huge and super cute packaging,2
"I don’t like that much the smell but this is great! All my life I had have dry lips, and this is great! I’ll definitely repurchase it!",2
I really enjoyed Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare. It made my skin feel smooth.,2
"I had resorted to organic baby wash to remove eye makeup and clean my easily irritated, very fussy skin. I have spent a great deal of time and money buying and trying cleansers that all irritated my sensitive skin. They were given away, thrown away or returned. I read the reviews here on this cleanser and ordered it and I am glad that I did! My search for an all in one cleanser and makeup remover is over! Removed all of my eye makeup, my skin was not red and felt soft after using just once! Just wish there was a daily moisturizer with spf and then this would be my complete skin care line! I will definitely buy this again and look forward to trying more from this line!!",2
"I received this as a sample from influenster. I love the ingredients, it’s like an all in one serum. It’s light and doesn’t leave your skin sticky! My skin looks brighter after using it.",1
I love most EL skincare. It is definitely moisturizing and makes my skin feel really good after use. I received a deluxe sample sample and got at about 10 days worth. in that time my skin definitely felt more supple and full.,2
"I love this sunscreen! It goes on so smoothly and absorbs quickly into my skin. It barely has any tint. It is a little bit greasy, but my foundation and setting powder take care of that. It just makes skin look a little dewy so if that is the look you want, this product is for you. It is also super hydrating which I need.",1
Really enjoy this product. It makes my lips very hydrated and soft in the mornings and even makes them less dry during the day.,2
"Went back to Clinique after using Murad because it dried out my skin so badly. I have used Clinique for more years than I can count at this point. In one wash it cleared up the breakouts and dryness I was experiencing from the other product. I can’t tell you how many consultants in Sephora are always trying to avoid selling this stuff to me, because it’s an old product. Old product or not, It works (and continues to do so) like a charm.",2
"I am really enjoying this product. I love that it dries without any stickiness. The scent is mild & fresh, nothing overpowering. I haven’t noticed any dramatic results but I also haven’t been using it but a couple weeks. I would certainly recommend for someone who is looking for a higher end moisturizer.",1
I love this moisturizer. I have very dry skin and nothing compares for me. Ive used Kiehls products for over 20 years and have never been disappointed.,2
"My favorite cleanser. This heavenly melt removes all my makeup, yet it’s so gently you won’t feel tight afterwards. I’ve already stocked up on another jar!",2
"It usually takes me a few weeks to see a different when I introduce a new skin product, but I was able to see a noticeable improvement after less than a week using this product. My skin was softer, more plump and more hydrated.",2
"I love the Sol De Janeiro line for the bum bum cream, shampoo & conditioner, body wash and now the lip butter. I thought it would smell like the bum bum cream it does not but I like the vanilla caramel scent. Not greasy or sticky very soft butter feeling and there’s a lot of product.",2
Love this moisturizer! I received this product as a free sample and very much enjoy how smooth and light it is.,2
Been using this moisturizer for almost a year. I do like it and would recommend trying it for anyone who has dry skin. Other moisturizers I would have to apply twice because my skin would absorb the first application so quickly. Do I think this moisturizer is slightly over hyped? Yes. But still a great product and worth trying.,1
"Love love love this moisturizer. It is perfect for my skin in the dry, winter climate where I live because it is VERY thick. I usually only use this at night because if I use it everyday, I think it clogs my pores and I notice an increase in blackheads. Only using it at night has resolved that problem.",1
"The first thing I noticed about this product is the packaging. It comes in a glass jar with a spoon to help get product in a hygienic way. The non symmetrical oblong shape of the cap drives me nuts though. They’ve discovered a way to force all of us to keep this product on top because you physically cannot stack anything on top of it. The product is a light beige color that has a florally scent that I could pass on. It’s a light weight cream that is honestly on the greasy side. It never sinks into the skin, just sits on top of it. I tried using less but it also doesn’t spread very well. It claims to target 6 types of eye wrinkles. I tried it for 2 weeks every day on 1 eye and it looks pretty much the same as the other. It is maybe slightly less wrinkled. But not a life changing product at this price. I received this product complimentary for review.",0
I struggled to find something to remove my black heads for so long. I exfoliate my nose with the exfoliation side for about a minute and I noticed a difference in only a couple uses. Definitely would recommend.,2
received a sample it made my skin break out in itchy hives and made my eyes swell and itch for 3 days straight do not recommend it also doesn’t moisturize very well either so 0/10,0
"There’s some people that love having an extensive skincare regimen with a product for every need and concern, and then there’s others who like to keep it simple - and SIMPLE is my middle name (next to “aging“ le sigh).  Less is more IMO which is why I love skincare products that offer multiple benefits, such as this one.  The product “promises“ to deliver a reduction on  the look of fine lines, visibly minimized pores, and brightening the look of skin.  I can say that after using it for a couple weeks, I have noticed a difference and now that I’m quickly approaching the 45+ category, it is even more important for me to find a product with visible results.  It’s think, lightly scented and absorbs perfectly, leaving me with soft, moisturized skin.  I usually brush my teeth while the cream works it’s magic, then I move on with the next step without skipping a beat.",2
"DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU ARE PRONE TO BREAKOUTS! Ok, I just got off of Accutane, so my skin has been clear for a while now. I used this on my face once, and I have 4 new little pimples (they’d probably be huge pimples if I hadn’t been on Accutane). Ethylhexyl Palmitate (the very first ingredient listed) is HIGHLY comedogenic, meaning it will clog your pores. I still give this 3 stars because I use it on my eyes and it’s alright. But I will never put it on my face again.",1
"I’ve used almost the whole container. It doesn’t make me break out or dry out my skin. I have sensitive, dry skin. This balm seems to take off my makeup pretty well. I double cleanse and this is my first cleanse.",2
"Amazing! I have combo skin, but where it’s dry, it’s super dry, and this has changed my skin for the better!",2
"After the first use my skin felt so soft, right after I washed it off felt like it started finally breathing.",2
I love this product! It’s my favorite night serum & I don’t feel bad about it!!,2
My skin feels smooth after this product but my face looks like it has a sunburn and felt uncomfortable. I would not recommend on sensitive skin.,0
"Great moisturizer, felt nice, heavy but stayed out.  Awesome for the winter months!  Felt spa like.",1
"I really like the sample of bare minerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum I received from PinchMe. The serum goes on very smoothly and lightly, and soaks into my skin fairly quickly. It didn’t make my skin feel greasy, but it was a nice moisturizer. It has a super light fragrance, and I’ve already bought a full-size bottle. Definitely recommend!",2
I’ve been using these for over a year. They have transformed my skin. I’m in my mid thirties and prior to using these I was experimenting with a few retinol creams and never found one that was a good fit. I stumbled across these and ditched the retinol and have been using these instead. It keeps my skin radiant and youthful. I don’t use them every week though as it’s indented. I do once a month and it’s the perfect maintenance for my skin to stay fresh and dewy. I also only use the padded softer side when I do my face. Can’t live without this!,2
"If you have sensitive skin, I don’t recommend it because of Vitamin C. My skin can handle this mask maybe once or twice a week. I use this on my neck and chest area more than face and it really works well for stretch mark+dryness. I bought it for face but use it more on body but whatever it works!",1
"I’ve been using these pads for about two weeks. I have been using them after I wash my face and before I put my makeup on. I use them on my face, neck and chest. I have been using it like an astringent. I have not been rinsing it off. And I will say, it has been working great, minimizing my pores. I guess I better start wiping it off with a cloth with water!",1
"This looks innocent and weak, but it’s not.This was a product I originally got as a free sample but have since become a committed user.This appeared so basic that I originally tossed it aside. When I ran out of my go-to cleanser, I decided to give it a try. It has seen become my number 1.I would give this 4.5 stars if possible.Pros:One of the gentlest cleansers that I use, and I use this as step 2 in my double cleanse nightly. No irritation or angry skin at all.It leaves my skin feeling very clean, but healthy.Does exactly what it says it does.Does not cause breakouts.Con:Has a slightly odd after-scent, a very very subtle one.I recommend this. I use it as a foundational piece of my skin care routine.",1
"Ohhh how I wanted to love this product! Yes, it made my skin glow....but it also made me oily and greasy and break out. So sad. Returned. The purple tint was so pretty on the skin. I’m so disappointed.",0
I absolutely love how this transformed my skin.  I have trouble in my t-zone area with blackheads and this scrub really helped diminish both the look and feel of these.  I instantly noticed a difference and it made my makeup and skincare applications so much better!  I did receive this in exchange for my review but it is an absolute must try product! Gifted by Dermalogica Sampling,2
"I was so excited to try this product as I’ve been looking for a primer and SPF to wear under my makeup. While it applies nicely... 2 days into wearing it I realized it was giving me cystic acne on my chin, cheek, and forehead. Nothing else changed in my routine other than this product. Very disappointed... especially since I JUST got rid of almost all my acne scarring from YEARS of getting facials. Thanks for the new scars!",0
Hands down best moisturizer I’ve tried for my dry skin. Leaves my skin with a nice radiant glow.,2
"I love Skinfix products so I was really excited to try out this cream. So far I am loving it especially the convenient & hygienic packaging where I don’t have to dip my fingers into the jar to get the product. You just need to open the lip, push the top part down & it dispenses just the right amount of product so no product wastage either. It has got faint to almost no fragrance which I really like, absorbs fast & keeps my skin soft & supple even during road trips when my skin gets quiet dry & needs some tlc to keep looking healthy & soft with no dry patches. For reference I have acne-prone combination skin.",2
It feels really nice when you spray it onto your face. The oil smell may be strong at first but it goes away after a minute. I’m not sure if it tightens my pores though...,1
"I loved the way this made my skin feel! It’s a great toner, smells nice, and applies easily. Highly recommend. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.",2
I received a complimentary sample of this product from Influenster and Estee Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This is a thick moisturizer. It does leave my skin feeling hydrated and soft. I like the fragrance. I don’t like the price point for it. It’s a decent moisturizer but not sure of what else it’s really doing for my skin other than moisturizing.,1
This cleanser was too good not to get a review. After playing around with my skin care routine and a month in Europe my face was terrible. Horrible cystic acne all around my mouth and jawline. Nothing of my normal routine seemed to work. I was fortunate enough to be getting my makeup done at Sephora when this was recommended. The next morning after using this my face was noticeably clearer. A week later all my acne gone. I will never be without this cleanser #holygrail,2
Loving the product so far. Use it daily with other products in the Fresh Rose line and my face has never been better,2
Amazing for my dry skin! The travel size works great for me as I don’t mask too often. I’m very scent sensitive and I had no problems with the light mild scent!,2
I received this product complimentary from #topbox and Clinique the sample size was small but from what I used the product is nice and would like to buy again,1
I love and trust Dermalogica so I was very excited when I was gifted by Dermalogica this oil to try. It feels nice and rich on the skin and gently washes away make up. Even stubborn mascara! I’ll be buying again!,2
"I bought this because I tried to switch from Tatcha since it got too expensive, but now I’m going crawling back to Tatcha. I was convinced the reason I was getting acne was my foundation, but now I realize its because I switched my cream to this. Its a bit strange because it doesn’t feel too greasy, but then an hour later my skin felt super dry and terrible. I had super clear skin on Tatcha and now I look like a mess. I use their eye cream too and I started noticing weird little pimples near my eye. Never buying this again. I stopped using this for a week as an experiment without changing my makeup routine and my skin started to clear up.",0
I got this in my 500 point gift and was immediately impressed! It has a light pleasant smell and removes my foundation beautifully. (I take my eye make up off prior to washing my face so I can not attest to its removal of waterproof mascaras or eyeliner.)What most impressed me was how soft and smooth my face was after! Definitely brightened up my complexion and left me hydrated. Absolutely recommend!,2
Originally I used this as a finishing spray and didn’t like the results. It made my face look cake-y and uneven. I decided to put it on after my moisturizer and lemme tell you IT CHANGED THE GAME. It gave my face the perfect dew without being too much. In addition to this my skin also felt soft and super hydrated. I used my Urban Decay all nighter finishing spray after I finished my makeup and it locked in my look all day. Love this product.,2
"I can’t live without this oil.  Whenever I feel a flare up coming on, I apply this, and it greatly reduces it.",2
I’m hardcore obsessed with this. It has a lightweight balm consistency that melts into the skin leaving it feeling so soft and nourished. There is no detectable scent either which is a huge win for me!! I like that it includes that retinol but pairs it with nourishing ingredients because retinol can tend to dry the skin out. It layers really well under my usual eye cream. The applicator is amazing and super easy to squeeze out the exact amount you need. This is a win!,2
I love this product. Great yet gentle exfoliation.,1
"This is the only product I have given fiver stars so far. If you have normal to oily skin, this product is soo for you!!! I love wearing this in the summer. It moisturizes with out being oily. When you put it on, its cool, refreshing, and non irritating what so ever. I always feel clean, cool, and crisp after i put this on. Works perfect during the summer under my make up. I definitely recommend this as a summer must have.",2
"I am really enjoying this exfoliating powder! The powder itself is so fine and the usage is not much. The while bottle can last quite long. After the first use, my skin is already smoother than before. This product is gifted by Dermalogica.",2
I really really wanted to like this product bc of all the good reviews but it’s just not for me.. it broke me out in pimples and these little cluster bumps with no white heads. it also made my face kind of sting and itch in my mouth area and made it really really dry. i did use the whole bottle to see if i just needed to get used to it but i just can’t use it. i also have sensitive combo skin so maybe something in it just wasn’t for me,0
"This stuff simply put is amazing. When I first opened the jar I notice the texture and appearance wasn’t pleasing to the eye. It looked very heavy and clumpy. However, the smell enticed me to continue sampling this product. It smells like grapefruit. When I applied it to my face I immediately thought, there is no way this is going to soak into my skin.... boy was I wrong. My skin sucked this up like it was in the sun for days. It not only moisturized my face, leaving it feeling refreshed, but it also cleared the “glossy“ areas of oils. I was sincerely shocked with how well this product worked. I will definitely be purchasing this product.",2
"I haven’t been using this long, but I already love how it makes my skin look and feel. Even though it’s an oil, it absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel greasy. I have sensitive skin, but it doesn’t make my skin red like some moisturizers do. This time of year, it’s a great help for cuticles, too. I just gave a bottle to my friend for her birthday!",2
Omg I love this stuff!!!!! Thank you!! This is definitely a must have,1
"Favorite moisturizer,hands down! Doesn’t leave my skin feeling heavy,goes on smooth, a little goes a long way too!I definitely noticed a difference in my skins appearance. Will definitely be purchasing a bigger size!",2
"This is one of the more favorites of cleansers I have tried out, and I’ve tried many. It isn’t stripping to my skin making it feel like it sucked all the moisture from my face; and it also didn’t leave a film on my face. This is such a sensory pleasing product to use from the super foamy consistency to the wonderful smell. My skin felt hydrated afterwards and plump. I also love combining this with my korres rose oil at night for a super clean and hydrated youthful skin look. I find this is one of the cheaper cleanser options per ounce on Sephora’s site and its a great more natural brand too.Only concern would be the smell or fragrance may affect some people’s skin if you have very sensitive skin to fragrance but I don’t find the smell over powering. I did receive this product from influenster to review.",2
I really liked this product. I didn’t find it as hydrating as I thought it would be; probably due to it being a stick. The ingredients are awesome which to me makes the product worth it. The way I use it is under my eyes and smile lines.,1
Got a mini size to test run it and it makes my skin sooo soft and smooth in the morning. Definitely putting it in my nighttime routine!,2
I like how easy it is to use. just apply when you notice your pimple before bed and remove in the morning. I noticed a difference in size of my pimple and would normally use it when I get them monthly.,2
"Great scrub to exfoliate if you’re a little more on the sensitive side. I personally like the Yo Detox better, but this one is great as well. It has a slight scent, just like the Detox, but it is not strong at all. I actually fancy the smell.",1
"I was so excited about getting this mask. I mean, it was all over social media as one of the best hydrating face masks. I normally have combo skin and then just started using retinol so my skin became super dry. I was hoping the mask would help with this. I wear the mask overnight and it does nothing for me most of the time. There are some days where it works and most where it doesn’t. It was pretty disappointing considering all of the hype it gets. Guess it doesn’t work for everyone! Glad I started out with the mini and didn’t buy it full size.",1
I think my fave eye cream ever (and I’ve tried a lot)! One of the only ones where I actually see the difference in my wrinkles AND it has made my dark circles less noticeable. Will be purchasing again!,2
This is an amazing product! It makes my skin glow in a dewy way. I actually stopped using powder and bb cream. Smells amazing too!,2
"Again, bought this for my husband who has psoriasis and it has worked beautifully. Used with their face cream has really helped his skin this past winter! He appreciates that it doesn’t have a perfumed scent.",2
"Out of the entire collection, their watermelon wipes is my favourite. I recommend it for those who are not as sensitive to smells as it is quite strong. As all their wipes, this one does the job!",2
"First off, this lip mask smells like berries",2
"I’ve tried a lot of.mineral sunscreens this year, and I had been wanting to try this from Drunk Elephant, because they have such a good reputation. I was shocked to find that the sunscreen leaves a white cast all over my skin. I’m a very pale person, and it showed up streaky and ghostly. To use the recommended amount of mineral sunscreen, it takes several minutes to rub this into my face and neck, and even then a cast is left. It is also quite oily, which is okay for me during the winter but I can’t imagine using this during the summer and not looking like a grease ball shortly into my day.",0
"the best cleanser ive ever used in my life and I have gone through 4 jars now. make sure u apply on ur face when dry and  ur hands are dry. rub and massage face well and gently around eyes and lashes. this will remove everything. I used to always follow my cleaners with Clinique #2 lotion and I would have so much residue left- with this balm, I have NO RESIDUE EVER. I have now gotten 6 of my friends hooked on this. its amazing and has cut down my nighttime routine so much",2
"I got this cream free from Influenster, and I am OBSESSED! It is the nicest cream I have tried on my face. It didn’t make me greasy like others do. My boyfriend even put some on after shaving and he was so impressed. I definitely will be buying another container when this one runs out.",2
"I’ve been using the essence as part of a SK-II regime. I use the cleanser, the lotion/toner, essence, and moisturizer. Since I’m not using it by itself I can’t really say much about just the essence. As a whole, using the entire system, my skin is clearer, softer, and more moisturized than usual. The essence has little smell and a very liquidity texture. You just shake some out and pat it into your face. I like the way my skin looks and feels when using this line of products.",2
"I was so very impressed when I started rubbing this on my face - it looked like extra skin was balling up and coming off of my face seconds after I started using it. After reading some reviews, it seems like it might NOT be dead skin coming off, just the product balling up and making it appear otherwise. I’m a little disappointed that the product makes customers think it is dead skin coming off, but either way I do think this is an effective product. I bought it because I got new foundation that made my sometimes flaky skin look terrible, and this has really improved my skin. I would say give it a try, at least get a sample and check it out.",1
At first I didn’t notice the difference in my dry lips but I’ve come to realize that it’s the only thing that helps when my lips crack. So it’s taken over my Jack black lip. It’s so good! And a little goes a long way. I use it throughout the day and I still haven’t made a dent in it after a couple months.,2
This moisturizer is great! It feels so smooth and fresh on my skin. I’d get it again.,2
Love this lip balm- its even better than the one in the pot! Great flavor! Its my new favorite!,2
"LOVE this cream- smells amazing, very hydrating, does not make me break out, and I love the way my skin looks when I wake up!",2
"Truly the only product that gets my waterproof, dry formula mascaras off. I layer them on top of each other and this baby is the only thing that will melt the mascaras away properly. Holy grail product.",2
i tried it for the first time and literally said “omg” as soon as i put it on my skin. i get it. it’s amazing. new holy grail.,2
"I used this for the first time yesterday as a sample I received complimentary in a VoxBox from Influenster and I am now a fan! I don’t really like using makeup removing cloths because they can be harsh on the skin especially if you have good makeup that doesn’t want to come off easily, so this product was right up my alley. it left my skin very soft and I didn’t have to deal with the cloths. I will probably never go back after using this product. thank you influenster for always sending me new products that I end up loving!",2
"I love this product! When I went into my local Sephora I was looking for an oil based balm/cleanser that I could use that would remove makeup and be great for double cleansing. I had some options in my hands, but one of the employees showed me this, and I’m so happy she did. It smells great and a little goes a long because it glides across the skin effortlessly. It removes all of my makeup, but doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry at all. I have combination skin that is sensitive and it is great for my skin type/any concerns I may have. I also like that it comes with a little spatula so I don’t have to stick my fingers inside the product. I’ll definitely be repurchasing this product when I run out!",1
hands-down best moisturizer I’ve ever used! pricey but worth it.,2
"I’ve been using this product since January and it has improved texture, dark spots and overall appearance of my 40 year old skin. I need only two drops morning and night to press into my skin. This bottle is still going strong and we are in May..Definitely worth the price point!",2
"This is my first time trying a Estee Lauder eye cream.. The product is amazing.. It’s soft, lightweight and easy to apply.. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and i have started to see changes. It leaves my under eyes looking brighter and feeling much softer..",2
"Works great! heals skin after pimples have been popped, and decreases redness and inflammation!",2
I love this eye cream! It seems like it would go on heavy but it’s actually really smooth and lightweight under your eyes. It’s one of the first eye products I’ve used that helped with my under eye bags and coloring too! Highly recommended.I received a trial size of this product to test from Influenster and Estée Lauder,2
I received a sample of this from influenster.A little bit goes a long way for this product. Leaves your skin feeling like velvet but I didn’t really see improvements in my skin moisture.,1
A very nice and light moisturizer. I have combo skin and this was nearly perfect for me. The product was easily absorbed and left my face feeling hydrated.,1
"I was really disappointed with this product. My face feels dry and tight after using it, especially around my cheek area. Save your money, folks, you can do better!",0
Gives a beautiful glow and plays well with other products. Knocked off a star bc I’m not sure how I like it under makeup just yet (I often have to use another primer). Other than that it looks great especially for no makeup days,1
"Retinol Cream did not irritate like others I have tried. Seems to make my skin feel smoother, but after almost finishing the bottle, I haven’t noticed much difference. I would’ve given 4 stars but the packaging really does not work for me, the pump sometimes sticks and not very practical.  Too much plastic, too big a footprint being that it’s only 1oz of product for such huge plastic container.",1
"I wanted to like this as I read a lot of positive reviews and it has great ingredients. I tried using it at night and morning also use different method of using as indicated. It is just not working for me, my skin break out every time I’m using this. I did use this as part of my 10 steps routine.",0
"This does what it says it balances my dry and oily areas on my face never leaving my skin tight and dry. Has a nice light mint smell that is not overpowering in the least. The smallest pea sized amount foams up like I could not even believe with my Clarisonic Mia, so one tube I can see lasting for a long time.",2
I received this as a product to test in exchange for my honest review. I’m sad to say it didn’t work well for me. It left a layer of film on my skin and didn’t smell very good. I also didn’t notice a change to my skin at all. Hopefully it works better for other people.,1
"Sunday Riley has seriously easily became one of my favorite skincare brand so I was so excited that they release this eye serum. I love the texture and consistency of the product. It feels very nice on the skin. I can’t wait to see further results once I continue to use it, but for now I absolutely love it!",2
While this product did give me smoother skin it also burned while applying. Not sure if it’s meant to do that.,1
For dry skin .I love it .must try!,2
I have very sensitive/dry skin - this is THE best gentle cleanser out there!,2
The best night cream!,2
"These work!! I started having an issue with small bumps and texture on my forehead…ugh. I had used these before with much success so picked some up. After a week, my whole face was sooo smooth. Also helps with the very fine lines I have on my forehead. I don’t know why it quit using these but I won’t make that mistake again!",2
I really did like this! It kind of tingled when I put this on but I really feel like it did improve the look of my skin and texture and pores!,2
I have super sensitive skin and this stuff works great. It doesn’t break me out and it keeps my skin moisturized. Love it!,2
"This cream is incredible. I’ve been using it for almost two weeks now, and noticed a difference in my skin almost overnight. It’s so refreshing and moisturizing and I’ve been so impressed with how my skin glows in the morning. I absolutely recommend trying this product!",2
This serum is so nice! Feels really lightweight and has the signature Fresh light cucumber scent with green tea as well. Adds a light layer of hydration to my skin that feels really nice. I have dry skin.,1
"The best cleansing balm out there! It’s so lightweight but gets everything off. The scent is lovely too. I’ve tried multiple cleansing balms, including Korean ones, but always come back to this one",2
I love this product! It has brightened my skin so much and evened our my skin tone! The smell is wonderful!!,2
"YTTP listened to the pump issue - maybe the product design change hasnt caught up with all the stores yet? but no more wasted product :) beautiful glass container that doesn’t strip too much away, and feels so good to wash your face after a long day out. if you’re in LA, you can return clean and dry empties to TARE for $2 off of YTTP products that they carry in stock, and the packaging will go back to YTTP (i think!). great initiative and looking forward to an expanded program!",2
Honestly I am very happy I made this purchase! I have some red areas ok my checks and this help neutralize it so much! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TRYING!!!,2
After using this for about a month I can confidently say ( pun intended) this cream is amazing. I added this to my regimen before bed and in the morning after washing my face. In a month’s time it feels lime my skin is firmer and much more hydrated. I’m very happy with the results and would consider adding this to my routine. The cream feels good going on and it settles in to the skin nicely without leaving a thick residue.  Great cream all around !,2
"the best balm to apply before going to sleep along with your skincare routine, feels so soft and the rose scent is amazing. xoxoxoxo",2
"i received this product from influenster and it has quickly become a favorite for me. i have dry, sensitive skin and find myself reaching for this over any other moisturizers i own. it’s lightweight but very hydrating. i’m obsessed!!! if you’re on the fence, just get it. 10/10",2
"I received my #freeproduct sample of Clinique’s Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream through #topboxcircle #tryitwithtopbox. I used a small pea-sized amount of this product on my entire face every morning for about a week. It contains a mix of peptides, HA, and soybean extract - these three ingredients aim to diminish wrinkles through collagen production, plump your skin with hydration, and fortify your skin, respectively. I found that it absorbed quite nicely, didn’t leave behind a greasy/oily film, and definitely left my skin feeling hydrated. Unfortunately, I didn’t see any noticeable changes in my fine lines and wrinkles as the trial period was too short. The price isn’t too too bad at$22 for 15mL, but considering it’s meant to be used on your face and neck, 15mL would be used up pretty quickly. I don’t think this is a good bang for your buck.",1
The best moisturizing for oily skin. It feels matte when I put it on. Does not have an oily or sticky residue. Its perfect. I wear just this moisturizer with sunscreen on a daily basis and my skin feels hydrated and matte.,2
comes w a lot of product to last a while. i use it a lot on my nose on my dry skin and it heals and protects quickly. highly recommend but if you use it to much it might cause oily skin.,1
"First I’ll say I’m very surprised that I love this! I have really dry skin and I typically don’t use things that say they’re oil free because those usually end up making my skin really matte and feeling more dry. However, this doesn’t make my skin feel that way at all. It does create a velvety texture on my skin. But that’s not a bad thing. Mt skin does have a healthy glow when using this. I’m able to use it on its own or under makeup which is great! It actually blurs my pores and fine lines and looks and feels like a nice primer for the face. I highly recommend this and I do think that it is worth the price tag. Our skin is the only skin we have for life. We need to protect it.",2
This sunscreen gave me good coverage and made my dry skin feel hydrated and not oily which is a must for me and I also love the size of the packaging,2
Got this as a free product from Influenster. I really love the texture of  product and it does not have  an overwhelming scent. Less is more with this cream! Makes my skin feel so nice and soft and hydrated,2
"To be honest, I’ve never really had “skin care routine“ per se, I’ve always been kind of just winging it. That being said, I’ve always assumed that washing my face and moisturizing was enough and that for the most part, all the other steps in between were just filler. However, as I am reaching the end of my 20’s, naturally I am noticing some things like the formation of lines, changes in my skin’s texture, etc. So I was thrilled to receive a complimentary toner to try out-- and from a company I’ve been hearing a lot of positive things about nonetheless. The toner has a lemony/vanilla scent that isn’t too strong and feels a bit tingly (as expected) upon application. For the record, I have a combination face with an oily T zone, especially on my nose. This blue bottle has been a game changer! Not only do I FEEL the change in my skin’s overall texture but the appearance of certain large pores/imperfections seems to have faded as well. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to apply a full canvas of face for a big night out, only to find inconsistencies like dry patches, flakiness, or an overly oily/porous ruining your application. As I am learning, toner is as vital a part in your skin care regime as a primer to your foundation or even a setting spray after everything is done. Overall I plan to keep using this product as I haven’t seen any irritation in my skin, and I can’t wait to see what a consistent month’s worth of use leaves me glowing like!",2
"This product is extremely light and absorbs quickly. I needed to use this in conjunction with a facial oil as it was not moisturizing enough for my extremely dry, flaky skin. I’m prone to eczema; this did not make my face flare up but it did not treat it either.  It’s a beautifully packaged product but if you need a more intense moisturizer, you will need to bundle with a facial oil or other product.",1
I love it! Made my skin clean and fresh. And it doesn’t make my skin dry.,2
I love to spray my face when I feel tired or when my skin feel dehydrated. The mineral water spray put moisture back into my skin.,2
This stuff makes my pimples go completely down in a whole day! I would highly recommend this stuff because it’s the real deal!,2
"This is another win from Farmacy. I’ve tried many cleansing balms and oils, and this is my top pick. It doesn’t irritate the eyes and it removes waterproof mascara with ease. It comes with a spatula and the scent is amazing. If you’re considering trying this product, do it. You won’t be disappointed.",2
Perhaps I don’t get what this is supposed to do.  My take was that it doesn’t moisturize but instead feels like a toner.  I thought “essences“ were supposed to be on the moisturizing side but it was not for me.  SKII products are so expensive so you can’t afford to not be sure.,0
"I was so happy when i received this free sample from Influenster and loved it. The scent is subtle but very nice, easy application and left my skin feeling soft and glowing especially for be because i have dry skin. I use this in the morning and evening after washing my face and before other skin care products.also another plus is the  beautiful  packaging.",2
Light and airy. Feels great on the skin. Have noticed a glow in my skin since started using,2
"What I liked about this SPF is it has niacinamide in the main ingredients.But it leaves this glowy and oily finish on my skin that I don’t like,  besides I have oily skin.If you don t have the tolerance to niacinamide it is not for you, because it can cause dry patches in your skin",1
I absolutely love this product. Even with the first use my skin had a glow and my pores looked smaller than usual I would definitely recommend this product. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes,2
"Honestly I keep trying new things but always seem to go back to this cream. It’s lightweight, goes on like a dream, and leaves your face feeling silky smooth.",2
"I’ve stopped using foundation because of this product! It is my desert island, holy grail item and i will use this product until I die! I have dry and sensitive skin that gets red all the time because im fair skinned, and im OBSESSED with this. You do need to use an oil or moisturizer before you put this on! It is NOT a moisturizer/foundation! So be sure to use it on top of your oil or moisturizer. 10000/10 for this product.",2
I like that it leaves my face glowy and fresh. It hasn’t irritated my skin and love that it has no fragrance. Not sure yet if it evens my skin tone would have to see when I finish the bottle so far I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks.,1
I love everything abt this mask. It doesn’t take a lot so it will last a looooong time. Has helped w my acne scarring/aftermarks too. :),2
"I got this as a sample and decided to buy the full size because it worked extremely well. Definitely open your pores with warm water before applying. I rinse it off in the shower after it hardens, and it makes my skin feel brand new and increases effectiveness of products I use after.",2
"I do like how the product made my skin hydrated and gave it a glow, but to be honest I didn’t think it improved at all on my aging lines (and I have really think lines). Plus it is too pricey for the result.",1
"love this! it goes on smooth,  not too thick and feels very moisturizing.  I’m a huge fan of anything from Glow Recipe",2
"This is a nice formulation; however, the scent is too strong. If they made an unscented version it would be near perfect.",1
So I just received this complimentary product from Influenster and I love it! The texture is almost like a gel feel but it soaks into the skin so nicely. I have dry/combo skin and I recommend it !,2
Good moisturizer for hydration! I have dry and sensitive skin. Works perfectly fine under makeup as well.,1
"It’s a good product, sometimes after washing my face it’s screaming for moisture and it’s very tight feeling. This helped with that feeling that I get sometimes. I’m not entirely sure if it did smooth out my skin or if it’s more placebo effect but I think my skin did look better in the days that I consistently used it vs before. Very luxurious feeling, beautiful packaging. Easy to pour out and it’s designed so that you don’t accidentally spill it all which is nice. Overall I do like it.",1
"I bought the sample package over Christmas that had this, the C-firma day serum, and the B-Hydra gel. I don’t like the feeling of products on my face - so much so that I don’t wear make-up. The products that i just must totally absorb into the skin. This does not do that. It leaves your skin feeling sticky. It did, however, make my skin feel very smooth in the morning, so it does work, but maybe i just rubbed all the stickyness off on my pillow.",1
"I bought this because everyone seemed to love it, but I am not a fan. I will try putting it on at night and although my lips feel good at that moment, they seem drier than usual the next day.",0
"Using this lip mask before going to bed means I wake up feeling luxurious and with kissable lips every morning! I also feel like my lips look plumper the morning after using it, which i love. would definitely recommend!",2
I really love using this product because it start clearing up my face within today’s. I like how soft my face become after using this. I will buy this product for life because I never seen a product that have instant results like this before.,2
"I love this stuff!! I got it in a Sephora favorites kit but the full size came in it! I love the concept of it being a stick, which means no need to get your hands dirty! I love the sensation when you put it on, temp wise it has a cooling sensation (im gonna try putting it in the fridge like it suggests for extra cooling effects) and feels like it goes from solid to water.. it’s a great wake up/pick me up for the skin! I see people saying it’s sticky, I just think initially it is thick, but once it sinks in you can barely notice, maybe it’s just because I have chronically dry skin. It also doesn’t feel heavy on my skin at all. I think this would be great under makeup!",2
I got the sample size for my birthday sample and omg it’s amazing! Day one I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin tone. I used it as a night cream for the first few days because it was pretty oily and it have me one zit above my eyebrow but I kept using it and once my skin adjusted it’s become a twice a day use love of mine. Absorbs completely after just a couple minutes and has made my skin look the best it ever has! Ordering the full size!,2
It’s an okay cleanser. It smells really gross though. There are a lot of similar cleaners on the market that don’t smell so bad. Not worth it to me.,1
"I’m on a mission to find a good quality balm that has some staying power, doesn’t taste awful and doesn’t block the pores around my mouth. This stuff is great! I did two rounds of Accutane 20 years ago and my lips have never been quite the same. I love this stuff, I have 3 tubes, car, home and purse. It has decent staying power but you can pile it on and it doesn’t get goopy. My other all time fave is the Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream, the original balm form not the lipstick kind. This is even better!",1
"I love these products! I know you’re not suppose to pick at your bumps or face but I do and then immediately put one of these dots on overnight and in the morning the dot will be white and my bump is flat to my face. Usually I have to use them twice in a row at night but I couldn’t live without my little acne dots! They can be expensive, Depending on how much you use them/buy them so that’s why I knocked a star but great product overall!",1
"There’s nothing in particular that wows  me about this moisturizer but I seem to be going back to it after trying out other ones. For me it’s a great summer moisturizer - lightweight and non-greasy. For the price point it’s definitely worth it, however if your skin is on the drier side like mine you will still have to use an overnight mask/ moisturizer as this won’t be enough.",1
"A friend of mine was telling about how awesome this stuff is, so I bought a little bottle of it to try.Let me say that this stuff smells amazing! It is light and definitely refreshing. I like using it for a little pick-me-up during the day and I’ve discovered that it’s great for the morning-after.I’m a little confused at what it’s supposed to do. I mean, it feels great on the skin- a little tingly and cooling- but I don’t really see any real benefit to using it.Bottom line for me? It’s cool, but I don’t think I’m going to rebuy it.",1
This stuff is sooooo good!! It looks like strawberry jam and it really does soften the skin and smooth the skin!! I’ve always kept up with my skin generally and have got many compliments but this product truly magnified it by 9000; I never thought my skin would look any better but this did it!!! Get it NOOWWWW!!,2
Absolutely love this balm!  I tried so many different balms and lip moisturizers / masks - nothing worked - my lips either got dryer or I got acne around my mouth.  But this WORKS.  It’s moisturizing but not greasy or heavy.  It doesn’t have a harsh smell and it doesn’t really have any taste.  I put on a lot before going to sleep as a sort of lip mask and wake up to great lips.  Highly recommend.  I use a lot of other Fresh lip products as well.,2
"I am so in love with this product. I have recruited countless people into trying it after I’ve explained how much I adore it. They all seem to really enjoy it as well! My skin is sensitive and I have no problems with this. It makes my sun damaged, dry & dull skin actually look beautiful. No word of a lie, people always compliment my complexion the day after I use this mask. Thanks REN <3",2
"I’m not surprised that it’s currently sold out! I use this with the HA from TO and I am in love! My skin looks amazing! Yes, it is a little sticky, but it fades away quickly!",2
"I use this literally on my whole body. Works as a body lotion and is minimizing stretch marks and imperfections, leaves a soft finish and will nourish your skin. Use it as a moisturizer and eye cream and even as a hair mask. If you leave it on for 30 minutes and then wash your hair you will end up with soft hair. I love this brand, affordable and delivers",2
"It’s expensive but worth it. This moisturizer is lightweight and absorbs into the skin, does not sit there, no flakes. I have really dry facial skin, once i use this, my face feels so good and hydrated, takes away dry spots and flakes. Ok to use under makeup as it absorbs into the skin. This moisturizer instantly feels like it nurtures my skin, and definitely helps diminish the look of the “fine lines”.Definitely hooked and worth the price.",2
I liked this moisturizing eye cream. It does what it says. Also it’s avocado come on!! I really love this whole overnight aspect too! It smells good enough not too overpowering not too subtle.. I see a difference in my puffy eyes. They are a lot less puffy more radiant! Thank you Influenster for this complimentary product,2
"I love this facewash, really good for my combination skins, leaves it fresh without overdrying. I also follow it with the Balance toner and moisturizer. Olehendriksen products have been the best for my skin",2
"This is a great product! I have sensitive, combo skin that tends to be dry in the winter. This product removes makeup and is perfect first cleanse at night. I rub it on my hands to warm it up and then gentle rub it on my face, including eyelids. Then I add a little water to slightly emulsify and rinse off. After that I do a second cleanse with a gentle cleanser. I’m giving 4 stars because the texture of this can be a little fickle. Sometimes the balm breaks up for the oil and messy oil comes out of tube. Sometimes the balm has the slightest gritty feeling but I’ve found warming up in hands first does the trick. Lastly, it does leave a little film so you do need to use a washcloth to remove or use a follow up cleanser if you don’t like that. I would buy again.",1
This mask is a life saver! Im always on the go and have been searching for the perfect product to use on the go to give my skin some life. This mask has been the product i have beeb looking for! Makes me look fully awake and gives my skin life again!,2
"I love when I use a toner and I can physically see the dirt on my cotton pad even when I think my face was already squeaky clean. This toner did that for me. I have dark spots on my back as well and this lightened them up already. It works very fast. And I also love the explanation they gave on the box. It explains why a good toner is essential to skin care and for makeup to look flawless. Informing your consumer is so important. It does not burn or irritate my skin at all. Helps keep my combo skin in control. Overall I love it and will continue to use it. Disclaimer: i received this product for free for testing purposes, all opinions are my own.",2
It makes my skin look amazing and bronzed but every time I use it I break out really bad. Also really hard to find and expensive.,1
I’ve heard many great things about this product but for me personally it didn’t work. It made my skin breakout.,0
"I LOVE this cleanser. This is my second bottle and I could never switch to another. I love that it foams, but doesn’t make my skin feel tight. It smells really fresh and a little goes a long way. I only use about half a pump per cleaning and that works out well. A bottle lasts me for quite sometime which is great. I’ve noticed a huge change in my skin since using it and I’ll never stray from it!",2
"Very useful and nice to use instead of a rough cloth, especially those times when u do not need an intense face wash.",2
"I am not someone who ever really thought about stopping wrinkles. My skincare regimen up until now has been an anti-acne wash in the morning. I received this tiny jar, and have seen a difference despite only using it for about a week! It’s impressive to me how far a tiny dab goes, and at this price, you want to know it will last a long time. There is minimal scent, it’s a wonderful texture - never felt oily at all! The pics I attached are 1 week ago and today. I feel a difference and I think there is a visible difference. Full disclosure, my 4 yr old woke me up after 4 hours of sleep and then we spent the day in the sun and hiked, so the pic may not be as illustrative of the effects as it could be after only one week. That says a ton to me because I can see a reduction on the crows feet. Worth trying!",1
I have oily skin and this moisturizer work GREAT under my makeup. Keeps me hydrated all day. Love using it in the morning and at night. A little goes a long way!,2
"I always wondered if this product was worth the hype since I have been reading about it for a few years now. I was always put off by the price but I figured all the positive reviews couldn’t be for nothing. This is hands down one of the best products I have ever used and it is worth the price tag. I use retin-a and have sensitive skin but lucked out and this didn’t bother me a bit - it stings a tiny bit in the the beginning but it quickly subsided for me. I was truly amazed at how great my skin looked afterwards. I bought it hoping to keep blackheads at bay and that the other claims of even skin tone and reduced fine lines and wrinkles would come along with it and they do. This works fabulously on blackheads and some past acne marks are fading much faster then using my other exfoliator. I haven’t been using it long enough to attest to the fine lines part, but I’m sure that with the great exfoliation it provides that your products would penetrate better. Will definitely repurchase!",2
"I love this stuff. I originally got it as a sample in one of my Play! boxes and chose to buy the full size. I do agree that it leaves a tightness after cleansing, but absolutely no dryness for me! That was my main concern. Tightness goes away with my typical moisturizer. This also got ALL of my makeup off and I didn’t feel like I had to scrub and wash multiple times to feel clean. I personally love the gel-like consistency, it lathers well, and it smells great. I feel good about using this cleanser day and night. Keeps my skin clear and washes clean!",2
"i literally sleep in this ever night as part of my daily beauty routine before bed.  i dont know why, at first i thought it was stupid, but it smells so light and fresh on my lips and it stays on all night long, until the morning and i wake up feeling it on my lips.  it is just very satisfying.  if you dont want to come off of the money to buy the full size, it comes in a few different sephora favorites as a mini, and will last a long time!",2
This cleanser left my skin feeling so fresh! I love how it’s natural as I’m trying to switch to clean skincare. It smells fantastic and my skin is radiant! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review from Influenster,2
"This is my all-time favourite cleansing balm. It dissolves my makeup super quickly, washes off easily without residue, doesn’t irritate my eyes, doesn’t cause new breakouts, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.",2
I don’t think it did anything extra to my skin. It simply is an everyday toner. Didn’t find myself less oily with prolonged use.,1
"I received this product in this year’s Sephora Favorites Skincare’s Next Big Thing kit. I have been using it as the last step in my skincare routine following oil, and in that sense I haven’t noticed its effectiveness. I do like the texture of the cream and plan on using it alone and seeing how it works. It has a pleasant smell.",1
"I live in Northern Ontario and it’s winter time. This is doing a great job at keeping my sensitive skin properly moisturized without upsetting my rosacea. It is pricey but it’s definitely worth it! Love the dispenser, it gives the perfect amount to use & keeps the rest of the product clean. If your skin needs a little extra moisture & tlc I highly recommend!",2
It feels dreamy on your skin and works wonders moisturizing my skin . It looks dewy fresh afterwards!,1
I recieved a mini one of these in my BoxyCharm and I was not disappointed! a little goes a long way and it removes all of my makeup. The best part is you don’t have to use a washcloth you just rinse. I’ll be purchasing the full size.,2
This literally did nothing for my skin. I swear by Sunday Riley’s UFO oil and bought this with Luna oil based on the rave reviews. It literally did nothing for my skin. I gave 2 stars vs 1 because I didn’t break out from it or anything....just super disappointed :(,0
"I admit, I don’t use moisturizer as often as I should. I have been using this for a month and love the way it makes my skin look and feel. Normally I’m apprehensive about using a thicker texture moisturizer due to my sensitive skin, but this didn’t give me any negative side effects. I didn’t break out or have any skin irritation after application. Would recommend!",1
Thai products is amazing! It works great! Definitely would purchase again!,2
Amazing. My skin looks and feels completely different after two weeks of use.,2
"As per the other reviews, the scent is pretty strong and sweet if you don’t like that kind of stuff. I liked how it felt at first but then I noticed it doesn’t dry down and absorb into the skin, and it also pills! I was so excited to try this but it’s honestly a flop.",0
"Too astringent. I have yet to find a toner I can use on a daily basis. More than two or three times a week and it’s too drying. Not bad enough for me to return it, but I won’t be buying more once it runs out.",0
"I know I’m supposed to use as an overnight mask, but I’ve quickly become addicted to how soft and moisturizing it feels on my lips that I wear it all day! I’ve been a die hard fan of the Jack black lip balms and this is definitely giving them a run for their money. I’m really enjoying the non sticky feeling. I would have loved for it to have a scent, but it’s does the job without one!",2
"I received a sample of this Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Cream from #tryitwithTopbox. I was able to use this sample for a week, morning and night. I did find it help keep dry skin my face moisturized, which can be hard to do now that the cold weather is here. It is oil free, so there was no residual greasy feeling. I appreciate it is also paraben free. #freeproduct",2
This has been the only thing that’s successful in getting rid of texture and bumps in my skin without causing an irritation. I would highly recommend this product to improve skin tone and texture,2
"The alcohol dried my skin out, and then made it into an oil slick within 30 minutes. I prefer their Grape Water spray, which I spray on before applying a hyaluronic acid serum.",0
"Recommended to me by a friend, but it just simply doesn’t work. I could put on cherry chapstick before bed and my lips would be in better shape than this. I don’t think it penetrates but just sits on top of your lips. I wish it would have been cheaper - expensive waste of money.",0
"I am fair-light, natural dirty blonde and my skin has tons of pink in it. I use Trader Joe’s “mid summers nights cream” with these drops. One pump of lotion then 3-4 of the drops per leg, per arm, per chest etc. for face I find 4-5 drops is best. Now if you aren’t careful at the wrists yes you may find a small streak but as for the body there is no streaming. The color is amazing and not orange at all. After using for a few days if you feel orange then it’s time to scrub it off and reapply. I get so many compliments on my tan and the best part it that it’s totally sun free. This stuff also does NOT have the fake tanner smell, very clean smelling. The only problem I have is that this product is always out of stock.",2
"I know it will sound hokey, but I burst into tears after trying this cream. Happy tears. I have rosacea and get very red on the cheeks, chin, and nose. My face is red and flushed all the time. I have tried EVERYTHING to minimize the redness, including super expensive prescriptions from the dermatologist that only made my face burn like it was on fire. I’ve tried super expensive cosmetic products and drug store brands, and everything in between to try and reduce the redness and flushed appearance I always have. My only saving grace has been thick moisturizers, full coverage foundations, and concealers. I’ve dreamed of the day I could leave the house without makeup. FINALLY!! This product is the only thing that has ever worked. I wake up in the morning, and apply a small amount to my whole face, paying special attention to my cheeks, chin, and nose and I can head out the door. It is a life saver! I even use it on those full makeup days and now don’t need full coverage foundations and barely any concealer. It’s a dream product, I pray that they never discontinue it. THANK YOU DR. JART! I will never use anything else.",2
I have tried every lip product out there and this is by far the absolutely best!!! BUY IT!!! You will love it !!!,2
"I received this Phat Glow Facial as a complimentary for my honest review.This one-step massage activated facial is to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots and pores. What can we ask more? It is so easy to use. It smells good and I love the texture. It leaves the skin very hydrated, smooth and it illuminated it. I will definitely use it a few times a week! It’s worth it!#complimentary",2
I’m obsessed with this !!! I bought it on a whim and thought I would end up returning it. Nope. My skin is so sensitive and prone to breakouts. I have to be so careful. I’m currently pregnant and I love this I checked the ingredients it had nothing bad !,2
"For this price point I was expecting a little more I guess…I wasn’t impressed. Smells great, but my face just didn’t feel clean afterwards. I will be finishing it since I paid enough for it but won’t be repurchasing or recommending.",0
Such a great product!! I received this complimentary to test out and wow I’m in love . Super hydrating and I love the ingredients. Would most definitely recommend.,2
"I have oily skin and have had a very hard time with it. I was afraid of a facial oil because of the word “oil“. I don’t want extra oily skin. But it is far from that, I started off with the 0.5oz the $15 one. And honestly on the first night I saw a difference is the texture and plumpness of my skin. I absolutely am in love with this product. Very lightweight and does absorb quickly. It doesn’t feel like most oils that just seem to sit on top of the skin. I recommend to both dry and oily girls.",2
"I have to say I am really loving this moisturizer. The formula is so rich and hydrating. My skin looks so healthy when I use it. I love that it doesn’t have an added fragrance to it! It has a very light scent that just smells like skin care. However, even though I typically like to invest in a good moisturizer, I do think this is verrryyy expensive. As much as I love the formula, I think the consistent use of this won’t be feasible for me due to the price. If budget isn’t a concern for you, then I say go for it! It definitely is a luxurious feeling formula. The only other thing I don’t love about it is that the packaging is a bit deceiving. There is a layer of plastic that surrounds the actual product and it makes the packaging bulky when it wouldn’t otherwise need to be.",1
"Very hydrating moisturizer for daily use. I love the light fruity scent and that you can easily refill the product without having to purchase a completely new jar. The jar itself is made out of glass and is great quality. I also like the light, gel whipped texture which glides onto the skin effortlessly. Love the Glow Recipe line with this being a staple!",2
I have normal to oily skin and while this product feels nice when initially applied it ultimately doesn’t make my skin look or feel any different. This is just a very basic light moisturizer that is way over priced.,0
"I was nervous to try this product, but a gal at a Sephora store explained what it was and how to use it. I did not buy it right away, but waited and purchased it online. I really love it. I have super sensitive skin, like I get nasty rashes on my skin and neck and use steroid cream, but this calms everything down so that I don’t have to use the steroids. I also use the heavier cream of this at night along with some of the Ceramidin (sp?) products. I love all of them. My bf uses this too for his super ruddy complexion and it evens out his skin and covers up the redness. I would recommend it.",2
"This moisturizer is simply amazing. It smells wonderful, its thin and light, and non-greasy. A little goes a long way ladies!! A tiny pat can easily distribute delicious smelling goodness all over your face. It’s so lightweight you can’t even tell you’re wearing it, save for the lovely  scent emanating off of your face! Within 2 weeks of using this my dry skin was gone AND my sunburn healed completely. It really is amazing. I received this product free in exchange for my open and honest review. All opinions are my own!",2
I use this in the morning after the Glow Recipe toner and love it! It makes my skin shine and gives a glowy look either without makeup or under makeup. I 100% recommend this product if you’re looking for soft dewy skin! The scent is light and enjoyable.,2
"I accidentally overused acids (glycolic toner, to be exact) and the stinging, burning, and peeling started. By the end of the day, I would have these massive dry, scaly spots. It was embarrassing! Then I remembered that I had picked this up on a whim last Black Friday. It was a miracle worker for my elbows last winter... Could it work on my face, too?! I put on two layers and went to bed, adding a little extra on the really dry, scaly parts. While it didn’t solve the issue overnight, I could tell when I put my makeup on the next morning that it was helping. I’m taking a break from acids and continuing to use this, and I’m excited to see how much it’s already healing my face. As an added bonus, m skin is pretty sensitive and it didn’t make me break out.",2
I really like this serum. I use it morning and night.  It really makes my skin smooth and more even. A little goes a long way too. It is expensive but worth it. I tried it as a free sample then after that was gone purchased the 2 pack.,2
The best resurfacing product I have ever tried that doesn’t dry out or irritate my already dry reactive skin.  I reccomend this to everyone!,2
"My boyfriend has RAVED about this product and I’m not even kidding, it’s amazing. I have gotten rid of my acne using a natural route but during my period my acne is SO bad so I reached for this and it clears my skin wonderfully!",2
Made my lips really dry and flaky. Not for everyone.,0
Smells lovely and has a really silky texture. Doesn’t leave me greasy which is great. Not sure if my skin feels fully hydrated though.,1
These are quite impressive I woke up the very next day with a clear soft nose!!!,2
I received this product complimentary from innisfree. Let me start off by saying this is the best sunscreen lotion by far and with that being said I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate or dries out my skin.  Sensitive skins out there I definitely recommend this product ❤,2
I have not wanted to try a different vitamin C serum after I found this. I have repurchased my second bottle and will continue doing so. I just wish the price was better. The lotion like texture makes it feel creamy and not irritating. It has a yummy citrus smell that I look forward to while applying. I like how it’s packaged in a glass jar to help preserve the vitamin C stability. This product can tingle slightly especially when used with retinol products. It doesn’t hurt or irritate. The form of vitamin C is the least irritating than the other cheaper ones such as l-ascot if acid. I’ve had other vitamin c oil type serums turn my fingers and my face red and orangey. This doesn’t make my skin smell strange like self tanner like other vitamin C “serums”. I don’t think there’s a better vitamin C product out there.,2
"My skin has gone through different phases, and most recently, it has become combination with acne due to an autoimmune health condition that I have. I read about this product in a magazine and decided to give it a try and got the mini sized one. I have medium dark skin and so I scar easily whenever I break out. This product balanced out my skin by controlling oil in the oily areas and moisturizing the dry areas. I put on three drops of this every night as my moisturizer and spot treat any pimples with salicylic acid products. Whenever I wake up in the morning, my skin has an amazing health glow, and after several uses I noticed that my acne scars started fading.It is really a great product, and even the little bottle lasts a long time. It has lasted about 3 months for me.",2
Love this! Does the job. Great deal for the price and it’s no mess because it’s a squeeze tube. No weird smell either like some other balms. Highly recommend. Will buy again for sure!!!,2
"I’ve been using this for a few weeks and have noticed improvements in my skin! I use the eye bomb before my moisturizers and the daytime I put SPF on after the eye bomb. The eye bomb is so cool, I really like it! I’ve noticed less dark circles under my eyes lately.",1
This absorbs so quickly. I have had such a hard time finding a lotion that would not take forever to “sink in“ and I found it!! It also keeps my face from feeling greasy an hour later. Love...Love....Love it!,2
"Gifted by Dermalogica sampling. I’ve never tried a powder exfoliant cleanser before and it was a good experience. I liked how soft my skin felt afterwards and the fact that it’s gentle enough that you can use it everyday. I didn’t experience any irritation or reaction, definitely good for sensitive skin. Add some water and scrub away!",2
This lip balm is my holy grail. It leaves my lips super smooth. Plus it smells like roses!,2
Finally a chapstick that works! This keeps my lips so healthy and soft!,2
Wow! Really leaves the moisturized and subtle. Normally I have to use both toner and a heavy cream. I have really bad dry/combo skin. This is great it is all in one and leaves my skin so soft,2
"After the winter my lips were wrecked, but increasing my water intake and using this daily helped heal them. After a morning application my lips are hydrated for the full day and I don’t need another application.",2
"My lips get soo dry during the winter and I’ve always used regular Chapstick, SoftLips, Blistex, Carmax..drugstore stuff basically. I decided to try something new and had seen this cute little tin in a beauty essentials section in a mag. Went to Sephora and I AM IN LOVE WITH IT! No wonder it’s been out forever...it’s so buttery and after two applications, the roughness was gone and my lips were soft and supple. I will always keep this on hand.",2
This cream applies nicely under my eyes and moisturizes enough for a smooth texture. I don’t have dark circles so I can’t attest to that but I can say that it reduces my puffiness and makes my face look more refreshed.,1
I read all the reviews and was excited to try this cream.  I have  sensitive somewhat dry skin.  This cream was not enough for me.  My skin felt tight and dry after using.  I added the Marula Oil and that did not help much.  My face also turned red after using.  I was hoping to like this but I need more moisture.,1
"I love this sunscreen, I got a subtle glow and my fave didn’t burn once in the hot sun all week.",2
I received this lip mask as a complimentary gift from Influenster earlier this month and I am now obsessed!! It smells so good and I wake up with the softest lips even in the dry summer heat. It is a bit pricey for the size but definitely worth it in my opinion and I have been using it daily for two weeks and still have a lot left. A little goes a long way!,2
I highly recommend trying this out - nice light tinted shimmer with SPF.  I use in combination with Dr. Jarts Camo Drops for a “no make-up“ vibrant look.,2
"This moisturizer reminds me of a coffee flavored ice cream that’s *just*melted. Still has a light, almost airy texture that just melts away into your skin. Like their Superfood Whip, this moisturizer is on the lighter side in its class. If you have drier skin this would make a good day moisturizer, combo to oily it would be better for night IMO. I have combo skin and this is the perfect weight for summer when it’s hot and sticky, in winter as it gets drier I like to layer a facial oil over it as needed. Clean, light, pretty neutral herb-y smell- nothing offensive",2
"This irritates my eye area just after ONE use! My whole Eyelid and under eye area have been red, swollen, itchy, for THREE days! There are products from Drunk Elephant that I absolutely like, but this eye cream I would definitely NOT recommend.",0
"I have acneic, sensitive, oily skin and just finished my first bottle of the Good Genes treatment as well as the Artemis oil and the results have been nothing short of amazing. Even my aesthetician has noticed that the texture on my face, especially on my cheek bones, has completely disappeared and I now have smooth texture that doesn’t show through my foundation. I use morning and night and my skin tone is definitely brighter and my dark spots aren’t as visible. This will definitely be a repurchase.",2
"These review are hilarious by the way LOL!!Yes, there is an odor when you first apply the cream but it goes away and the results are great! Smooth skin:)",2
I love love Iove this sunscreen! This is has been a magical product. I have alway been big about wearing sunscreen. The sunscreen can be a little oily when you first apply it  but my skin absorbs it and leaves my silky soft. I got this thur Influenster for my honest opinion. I think it worth the price. The older I get the more I’m willing to pay for my skincare! I highly recommend this.,2
"Obsessed! I’m pretty normal and sometimes get oily in the skin, I spray around my cheeks and temples and this gives me the best healthy glow without looking sweaty or glittery. For the girl that wants a natural highlight, you must get this!!!",2
I had used this product  several years ago and was so happy to be reunited again. Compliments from Beauty Stat. This is my go to eye cream when my skin is feeling parched. It simply moisturizes and softens they eye area leaving it more awake.,2
This is just okay. It’s a basic cleanser. I didn’t have any big reactions to it good or bad. In a blind test I don’t think I’d be able to tell the difference between this a drug store cleanser. I typically give 3 stars when it works but it’s nothing great and it’s too expensive for what it is. I won’t repurchase and wouldn’t recommend. I really don’t get the hype at all...,1
"I tried a sample of Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel from PINCHme! I am glad I did! Loved it! Easy on. Easy off! Skin feels soft,  smooth,  supple!",2
So far so good. I use this about once a week and it makes my skin nice and soft after using. Definitely gets rid of the rough parts. Plus it’s nice to get a little facial massage from the beads when washing it off.,2
"I struggle with acne and dry patches at times , and i loved this so much covers so well for being light coverage , i did prep my skin with hyaluronic acid - 2 sunscreens and a moisturizer , i set only my crease areas and it set like a medium coverage foundation i love it , if you have oily skin maybe try using it as only a color corrector not as a bb cream like me it may be to oily for you sorry babes:/",1
I am in love with this product. Most moisturizers either make me break out or make my skin greasy. This is amazing it hydrates incredibly and noticed automatic results. Definitely will be purchasing this as soon as I run out.,2
I been using this for about 2 weeks now and I love it. I would buy it again.,2
"I’m skeptical of face primers. I have excessively oily skin, and absolutely nothing works to keep my makeup from breaking up like dunking my face in copious amounts of powder... That is until this product. Here I sit, on a warm summer day, with a velvety matte complexion, and an almost full face of makeup. There’s no powder, and yet no shine, just a lovely glow. I love the finish so much, I now forego foundation, and just use other makeup on my bare skin. In that respect, this does function as a skin care product for me as well as a primer.",2
"Very lightweight and invisible, no white residue left behind after applying it onto skin. Has a lovely scent. Protects against harmful UV rays. Infused with vitamin C, which brightens and moisturizes the skin. Helps gain more elasticity to skin. Great sunscreen . Love using this daily.",1
I have a sample of this from Influenster and was excited to try it. A little goes a long way and it goes on pretty smooth. The smell is not overpowering which is great because you don’t have to smell it all day. It’s hydrating and gel-like which feels lighter than other moisturizers. It’s not overly oily however I have oily skin and it seemed shiny after a few hours. I would recommend to other skin types.,1
Its hard to find cleansing cloths with the exfoliating beads on them. I went in to get a brand name one and they were out of stock so I asked the sales associate if there was another brand. She showed me these and they are great! Two sides one is soft the other with the exfoliating beads .I will definitely  buy again.,1
"I received a sample and, after using it twice a day for 3 days, ran out to buy several bottles during the recent Sephora 20% off Rouge sale. This toner is wonderfully light, refreshing, and cleansing. It is not oily and actually extremely fast-absorbing! Don’t be fooled, though. It IS effective. I used it after a splash mask in the shower then applied retinol serum and oil afterwards. My skin was red and sensitive for the next 2 days. Since then I’ve stuck to my normal (daily) regimen of Moon Juice cream cleanser, GR watermelon wash-off mask in the morning, this toner, Blithe Essence, GR pineapple serum, GR juice moisturizer, and Tatcha eye cream. I go to Korea every other year and stock up on products, so I know ehat is out there in terms of effectiveness. This toner is very high quality and everyone will benefit from the decongested pores, hydratation, and glowing skin it imparts. You just need to figure out what combination and frequency works for you!",2
"I love this on it own or over make up. My skin looks so hydrated and dewy. If you have combo/oily skin, like myself, not much product is needed. A couple sprays of this should do the trick! Definitely recommend.",2
"I received this item as a sample in exchange for a review, but I’ve already used it even prior to the gifting. This serum is great for night time skincare! It’s a bit expensive but it really does work, it leaves my skin feeling so plump and healthy in the morning. Ive noticed it also helps clear away some of my scarring. I’ve even purchased this as holiday gifts for family members before.",2
"Although it’s a bit pricey, Fresh Soy Face Cleanser is worth every penny. I spent years trying cleanser after cleanser, and this is the only one I have ever found that both completely removes my makeup and leaves my skin feeling comfortable and not dry.",2
"I have dry, sensitive skin. This face wash removed my long wear make up without stripping my skin!  Didn’t break me out or irritate my skin.",2
I have combination skin and have always found that face washes are too harsh and dry my face out. This is the ONLY face wash I have ever used that didn’t leave my face feeling tight or dry after use! It does a great job at taking make up off and is definitely a staple in my beauty routine. Highly recommend this product!,2
I love love love this product. Only thing I trust to get ALL of my makeup off my face before cleansing.,2
"I love this product. I received it as a free sample in the mini version. It has been such a blessing. I have extremely sensitive skin and this never hurt me or causes any issues. I regularly use it on my lips as a treatment while I’m getting ready in the morning and I haven’t had chapped lips this winter, and I’m a college student who walks outside a lot to get to my classes so I will most definitely be purchasing this again when I run out.",2
I received a complimentary sample and really enjoyed the product. The pads were easy to use and were not too strong for my extremely sensitive skin -  I didn’t feel any irritation afterwards or experience a breakout,2
"Exactly what I was looking for! Super light when you put it on, and still feels moisturizing.",2
"I loved it, it’s so powerful and light at the same time",2
"I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. This sunscreen is amazing, it’s one of my new favorites. It smells nice at first, but after a while the light scent goes away and it smells like normal sunscreen. I love that it has a high spf. I’ve always heard people rave about this sunscreen, however, I’ve also been warned about the terrible white cast. This new formula looks like lotion but becomes completely see-through once you spread it out. I would definitely recommend this sunscreen!",2
"Smells really good and does a great job with hydration. I live in the desert so my lips are dry and chapped frequently. I used to carry chapstick every where I go, but I don’t need to anymore. Using this nightly keeps my lips hydrated throughout the day.",2
"This is the only sunscreen that I have found to work for my sensitive acne-prone skin. Chemical sunscreens and fragrances (even natural) irritate me. Silicones and many natural silicone alternatives such as coco alkanes aggravate my cystic acne, so every other mineral sunscreen I have tried has been a failure. One interesting thing about this product is that although it is quite dewy on my combo skin, the zinc actually keeps my t-zone from over-producing its own oil throughout the day, and doesn’t dry me out either. Also, I have light-medium skin and there is a very slight white cast but I find that it makes my face look brighter in a nice way.The formula does take some time to work into my skin, but I’ve come to enjoy the healthy feel of the oils being absorbed. To avoid pilling, I apply just enough to cover one section of my face, work it in immediately, and then move on to the next section. If you let it sit in one section while you work on another, it can pill by the time you get to the later sections. I rarely write reviews but I had such a hard time finding a sunscreen, I hope this can help some other folks with similar issues. I hope DE keeps this around and never changes the formula!",2
"This is an expensive face cream, and is worth every single penny! I don’t know what kind of magic is in this tub, but my skin has never looked better. I use this at night and in the morning it looks plump and fresh. I’m getting compliments on my skin all the time now, which after having acne issues for years is so nice to hear. I have sensitive acne prone skin, and have no issues using this product. Using this with a few other products has helped clear up my skin a lot to where I rarely have breakouts now. While this says cream, its more like a lightweight gel to me. And I love that it pumps into a hole in the top, nothing I hate more than a tub of product you have to keep digging into.",2
This is the first cleansing balm I’ve ever used and I love it! I’m very familiar with Clinique’s makeup and skincare and this is such a win!! I love rubbing it in and seeing my makeup just melt away! This products doesn’t leave my skin greasy feeling or dried up. Highly recommend.,1
i was expecting a gentle exfoliator but didn’t feel like there was any substance to this product and it was pricey for what it didn’t do.  I tried to use it with my Clarisonic and it didn’t do much.  Returned it.,0
"I do have mixed feelings with this moisturizer.  1st don’t get scared by the word butter it goes smooth and weightless and works great under makeup at least for me. It does not have a heavy smell either.  Now, the jar was kind of empty was not filled out to the top. So far it has performed well  I just don’t know if it’s worth the money for the amount I am getting but, I do like it.",1
"I’m 24 and have good skin that isn’t prone to breakouts (unless I have way too many trips through the McDonald’s drive-thru). I was interested in a retinol but knew I didn’t need a super strong version of it, so when I saw this retinol alternative I jumped and bought it!  I didn’t expect the purple color but I LOVE it!! It makes my skin SO glowy with and without makeup on top.  Since using this I have noticed and received compliments on how radiant my skin is. When I finish the bottle, I do plan on repurchasing this product. One note: a little goes a long way, you only need about half a pump to cover the whole face thoroughly.",2
"Then it started drying out my face. Read more on oil cleansing and learn its best for oily skin, not combo like mines.Like that this is all natural.Still love Josie’s products, I use her argan oil as a moisturizer.",1
Purchased with really high hopes but fell flat. I would not consider my skin sensitive by any means but this mask made my skin burn slightly. I tried it a couple of times but still irritated my skin and didn’t produce results as hoped. Ended up having to return it. Would not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.,0
I really like this face cleanser! My skin can be pretty sensitive and tends to take a bit of time to adjust to a new product (usually breaking out a ton at first) but I didn’t have that problem with this! My face definitely feels softer and a bit more even texture wise. I wish that it would help with dark spots a bit more than what I have experienced. But overall I really like it and although it is a little pricey it does last a long time since you only need a small amount to cleanse your face!,1
I fell in love with this product when I saw it. I love their packaging. This one is in the shape of a plum. This serum is perfect for my skin. The consistency is very lightweight and absorbs fast. I love glow recipe all their products are awesome. I give this five stars. I received this complimentary for testing purposes.,2
I received a sample of this and I loved it so much I had to buy the full size! I have super dry skin and this saves me every day! I use it morning and night. It doesn’t feel too heavy and it doesn’t leave a greasy finish.,2
"Will buy it againI had one small bump under my eye after sun bath. Nothing had helped me heal it. After I started applying “smoothing eye cream” I noticed significant healing process. A week after applying it, bump disappeared forever. I will come back to this cream !!",2
"This glow recipe avocado ceramide recovery serum is sooo nice! This serum is such a nice, light, milky texture. It smoothed over my skin quickly and absorbed fully with no leftover residue. It visibly erased the dryness and left my skin so soft and hydrated and this lasted for hours which was amazing when typically even with moisturizers my skin is dry again several hours later. It did not irritate my skin after using I will be putting this with my skin routine for sure also the smell is like a melon kinda avocado smell very nice highly recommend",2
"I received this product through Influenster in exchange for an honest review.  I found this cream to be super luxurious and rich, as well as super hydrating.  My only down side to this product was the smell, it is very heavily fragranced with a floral scent that is somewhat overpowering when you open the jar.  It does dissipate after a while, but it’s still a lot of fragrance in a face cream.",1
"I have tried a lot of face washes and this is BY FAR my favorite. I have combination skin - actually, I used to before this product. Not anymore! This has been a game changer for my skincare routine. My skin is more balanced now and this keeps it in check from being too oily in my T-zone without over drying my skin. I never get oil slicks anymore. It also froths up really really well, unlike a lot of face washes, so you don’t need much. This mixed with Origins United States toner is the best if you have combination skin.",2
"I have been using this product for a few years now and I can honestly say it works at lightening my undereye and keeping the darkness at bay. I use it primarily at night when I dedicate more time to my skincare routine and apply it before applying eye cream. It’s efficacy was all the more apparent when I stopped using it for a while, I hadn’t realised until then how well it works! For $7 you should give it a shot.",2
Love! Using this for about 3 weeks now daily in the AM and my face always feels nice and hydrated.,2
"There is a reason this product is a holy grail for so many!!! I absolutely adore this primer. I find that it just sits perfectly under any foundation I use. The subtle smell is nice too and not overpowering at all. It’s just so smooth and luxury. It’s moisturizing, it’s lightweight, and it feels like i’m just adding onto my skincare. I’ll always recommend this primer to everyone!",2
"I love the way my skin looks after using this moisturizer! Although it’s thick, it isn’t heavy on my face and my skin absorbs it quickly, leaving a matte finish. The cream smells pleasant, and I like that it has salicylic acid in it- good for my mature skin!",1
"I’ve been using this essence for about 4 weeks now, and I see such an incredible difference in my skin! I have sensitive, normal-to-dry skin with occasional breakouts and this product has NEVER irritated my skin. Some people say the grass isn’t always greener with pricey products... well let me tell you the grass is so green over here it’s insane! It is a little pricey but man does this give you the most beautiful skin you’ve ever had. Definitely repurchasing after I finish this bottle. I’m BLOWN AWAY.",2
I have been battling with acne for a long time and just recently my dermatologist put me on medicine that dries out my skin. This mask simply fixed my skin in matter of minutes- the dry skin is gone! And I feel like I’m glowing— my confidence from before acne is back!,2
Let’s start with the eco friendly jar design. I love how it has refill pods & this beautiful jar can be reused . Well done glow recipe. It’s super hydrating formula. My face looks hydrated & smooth. It absorbs really quick. Little goes a long way. What I really like about is that it has no added fragrance which I really dislike. It has a neutral smell.,1
Holy grail moisturizer for oily skin in a humid climate,2
"** I received this product free for testing and reviewing purposes **I loved how lightweight this oil is, as it doesnt feel like its clogging your pores. I use about 3-5 drops and it felt quite nice on my skin. Its moisturizing and is actually really nice as a hand/cuticle oil also. I know it’s supposed to be used on the face, but It can be multi-purpose. The smells is lovely but a tad strong for the face.Overall, this was a great, lightweight and beautifully scented oil that I would use again!",1
Received a sample from Sephora w my purchase. My cheeks started turning red so I washed it off. Hope it is better tomorrow,0
"This has been a savior! Ive been pairing this with the rice powder foam wash and my skin is 80% less oily than before! I used to use aveenos foam wash due to my sensitive skin, but so glad i purchased the bestseller kit. I just purchased the larger size and will forever keep this in my skincare regimen. Totally worth the big bucks. My face is no longer oily and quite matte and beautiful :)",2
I really liked using this product everyday after I washed my face and before I put on my makeup everyday. I really saw an improvement. I received this product for free to try out from influenster.,2
Great cleanser!! My skin type is extremely dry and usually cleansers make it worse. I decide to give it a try and I love it it doesn’t dry my skin at all.,2
"I am IN LOVE with this product. The consistency isn’t too think or thin, and I can clearly see how bright and hydrated my eye area looks after applying. I was taken by surprise when I found out that the applicator tip is some sort of cooling ceramic item. It’s always COLD to the touch. I’ve sued this every day and I’ll definitely purchase it again in the future.",1
Best product for my skin . It took the redness and the bumps away . Definitely a great product.,2
"I like this a lot but unfortunately I just read in the ingredients that it contains xylitol which is toxic to dogs and that does make me nervous. I mean obviously my dog isn’t going to eat it, but sometimes my dog licks my face and I do worry about this containing xylitol.",1
"I love this product! I had tons of acne and my skin was almost always flakey and dry, but it feels soft and moisturized every time I put this on! Works perfectly for dry skin and teenage skin. (Also works well if you put on “confidence in a cream“ from here beforehand). Also works for dry lips! The only con is that sometimes I have to dab my face after using so that it’s not too wet, but I will be purchasing this again in the future!",2
"I absolutely LOVE this oil, I cannot rant and rave about it enough.  The smell is very reminiscent of J’adore Dior which is one of my favourite perfumes.  The formula itself is not too thick or heavy, closer to a watery consistency like the names suggests and absorbs like a dream, leaves my skin feeling absolutely glorious",2
i love the belif aqua bomb! it is so nice. it makes my skin smooth and soft and i love the smell. my skin stays moisturized for a long time! i also think this is a nice moisturizer for oily skin since it has almost a gel feel.,2
I have normal/combo skin and use a moisturizer daily. Thought I’d give this one a shot since I was in the market for a water based moisturizer. After a few days of use I developed terrible acne around my chin and noticed more developing on my jawline. I immediately stopped using this as it was the only change to my daily routine and haven’t used it since. My face had taken over a week to clear up but is slowly getting there.. Will be returning.,0
A true luxurious wash. Buffs away impurities and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth. Highly recommend for dry skin.,2
Goes on smoothly and evenly. Great moisturizer! I used it first thing in the Morning and didn’t have to moisture no ore that day! Good for dry skin!,1
"I’m completely obsessed. I used to wear a pretty full coverage foundation, but have been dialing it back. This is all I wear now. Love it so much!",2
This is the most hydrating eye cream I have used. I had some dry spots in my inner corner and this cream moisturizer this spot in 2 days and it went away. This is also great before makeup. This product does not leave any residue it just soaks right into the skin. It has a very fresh smell to it which I love to use in the morning.,2
Love it. Parfait pour tout les soirs. Bonne quantité. Par contre ne sent pas vraiment la vanille.,2
"I don’t understand the allure of this product (no pun intended). When I used this overnight as directed to, it did nothing special for me. I use Aquaphor every night and this product didn’t work as well as that does. I was very disappointed. I use this during the day as a lip balm if it is right there next to me, however, I never intentionally reach for this product. This is just any other thick lip balm in my opinion.",1
"I thought this product was great when I first tried it out but it just dries my skin. It makes my face feel dry, not clean, and I don’t have dry skin. Not worth it in my opinion. Although, the smell is refreshing and perfect for summer.",0
This stuff is great. It really stings at first but I was able to keep it on for the full 20 minutes. My skin looks so refreshed each time that I use it. I always put the mask on at night and can really tell a difference the morning after! I will definitely be repurchasing!,2
This cream was a game changer for me! I moved from humidity to a drier climate and was having the worst time with my skin peeling and getting extremely irritating. It is thick and very moisturizing but doesn’t feel heavy on my face.,1
It Works great for me. I loved this item and it worked so well for me. I would recommend this to anyone looking for fun extra steps or things to add to their skincare routine. It came quickly and worked great!,2
"Skin must be bone-dry before applying. First few times I used - I thought meh.... but then realized my skin was still damp. I don’t even need the max 10 minutes on sometimes now that I apply it to perfectly dry skin. Also great mask to use in a double mask session: This first, wash off then apply a moisture mask (loving Laniege Water Sleeping Mask). Age: 41 Skin Goals: Plump, Dewy, Line-free",2
"I got the Korres Poreless skin as a sample from Influenster and Korres, in exchange of my honest review. I have a very acne-prone skin, and honestly I have struggled with acne and large pores ever since I was a teenager. I have tried every single product that treats those issues possible, within my budget and I have never seen something treating my pores like this one.I applied a very large amount on both sides of my face, specifically targeting my cheeks. I felt an instant tingling to my face, and about 5 minutes later the changes were clear, my pores shrunk dramatically. Because this product is so great I didn’t feel the necessary of applying primer before foundation.",2
"I love it, it really melt my makeup off quickly and easy...",1
"Let me start by explaining my skin type so you know if this review is even relevant to you: I have young, slightly acneic skin that can be oily all over, or dry all over (not just t-zone). Most acne washes were too drying and everything for dry or even combination skin would make me oily. I use this at night and avoid washing my face mornings and my spots have begun to disappear. It hasn’t been too drying, but has effectively cleared my acne. Will definitely buy this again.",2
"Non drying, It defintly goes a looongg way, i use it every night and i’ve hada it for about 4 months, only half way throught the bottle. the only thing i would wish for that it was a bit more natural.",1
I love this product! I have used the enzyme scrub three times now (twice on my face and once on my neck) and the difference is truly visible. My skin looks healthier and more fresh/glowing than it has in a long time. The morning after the first use I couldn’t stop staring at myself in the mirror; my skin looked so good!I will be purchasing the full size product as soon as I start running low the travel size. Highly recommend this product.,2
"I have suffered from cystic acne for 6 years.  I have tried every recommend product and spent A LOT of $$$ on stuff that cannot hold a flame to this product.  I started using this product 2 weeks ago.  It took 1 day to start seeing an improvement in the battle against cystic acne.  My neck was badly scarred as a result of dealing with this problem.  It took about 8 days to start seeing the damage slowly fade.I was so impressed by this product that I purchased a bottle for my son.  It worked it’s magic for him as well.If you try this product you must give it a full 2-3 weeks to see the results,  I use it 2x a day and it has put a end to my acne and scars!",2
"Really wanted to love this product, but i’m using it daily for a few weeks and no results so far. Will not repurchase it",1
"My skin LOVES this moisturizer. I have super red, combo/dehydrated skin but after a few days of using this at night, my skin is so much happier. The redness is reduced and the dehydration is balanced. I’ve repurchased this a few times and I’ll keep restocking it.",2
"I was looking for a product to even out my skin,short of having a lazer treatment. This product was recommended to me. A little goes a long way and if your skin is sensitive,this product is NOT for you as the acid does sting. I’ve noticed that I am not using my Dr. Brant Microdermabrasion scrub but once a month now. My skin is smoother, less blackheads, blemishes and scarring.",2
Absolutely love this balm! I received it in my voxbox complimentary! And I couldn’t be happier about it.  It’s super lightly tinted goes on almost like an oil and leaves my lips pillowy soft and glowing !! The peach scent is perfect for summer with out being overwhelming sweet.  And it’s not sticky so my lips don’t end up hairy ! Love !!,2
"I used this while experiencing a particularly difficult breakout, and after trying several other treatments first. These pads worked perfectly by clearing up the acne I had. It also prevents the acne, and I often get the disgusting cystic acne. Try it!",2
"Feels good going on  and adds a hint of dewiness.  However, make sure your mascara is waterproof otherwise you’ll have black smudging under your eyes.",1
Love this mask! I live in a very cold climate during the winter which severely dries out my skin. This mask helps keep it moisturized and looking hydrated.,2
Felt abrasive like a physical exfoliant which is very concerning for my sensitive skin.,0
Sun protection is very important and this Shiseido  Urban Environment Fresh Moisture Sunscreen Broad spectrum spf 42 is another great product. Apply 15 minutes before exposure to the sun and reapply after swimming or extended time in the sun. This did not cause any skin irritation. This was not hard to rub into the skin and dries pretty quick. My skin was slightly sticky and a bit pale after applying but that went away after 10 minutes.,2
Recently my face has been breaking out really bad and with the acne came dry skin everywhereee on my face. So i went into Sephora looking for some help I didnt want to get a different moisturizer because I wasnt dry allll over my face just in certain areas well the SA suggested argan oil and I cant rave about it enough. it moisturizes and does not cause me to break out. Ill admit I was hesitant to try it because oil on my face just sounded like a recipe for my face to break out even more but it definitely has helped with my dryness and no break outs to date. I use it everyday and still have alot left in the $14 bottle. A little goes a long way so itll be months before you need to buy another bottle even the smallest one.,2
"I like it.  It is very good and I use it.  But I think the publicity has been very exaggerated, it is not magic either.",1
Helped to clear up my skin overnight!,2
"I absolutely adore this product! At first, I was so hesitant to try this because it’s pretty expensive but I got one of the little samples from the “free with purchase“ and I was hooked! Not only did this product smell great but it worked wonders for my skins. It helped smooth out my skin and gave me a glow from within. I got so many compliments from friends and family asking what I had done because my face just had a glow to it. Plus, a little goes a long way, all it takes is about 3-4 drops in my palm and pat it on my face. If you’re hesitant, just try it or at least try a small bottle of it, it does wonders!",2
"I received this product from Glow recipe complimentary in exchange for my honest review. Can I just say WOW! Honestly, I’ve used other products from this brand before and it has never disappointed me, but this stuff right here is my new holy grail! I suffer from redness on my cheeks, more like red blotches. This stuff actually does what it says it does with instantly reducing redness! Now, like their other products, this stuff smells AMAZING! It feels amazing on the skin as well, I love how it glides and melts right into my skin. I also noticed it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and looking plump. This stuff definitely works better than other serums that states the same claims as this one. As always their packaging is super fun and cute!",2
"Before using this product, my forehead was covered in white heads and a few cysts, and had been like that for the past year. After about a months use, my forehead is basically almost clear! I highly recommend to anyone and everyone with any skin type and concern!! If you’re considering buying this product, just get it! You can always return it if you’re not satisfied.",2
"This is my favourite cleansing balm, and it is worth the hype. Although it is definitely on the pricier side (compared to, for example, Elf), I think it’s worth the price. It removes makeup really well, including eye makeup... and without making my eyes too blurry. It offers quite a luxurious cleanse, and washes off easily. Non stripping! Totally recommend this.",2
I really liked the texture of thecream and a little bit went a longway.I received this as acomplimentary gift so I had a trialsize. I would be willing to try it outfor a longer period of time,1
"I almost finished the whole bottle and still see no difference. I have dry, sensitive skin and this provided no noticeable improvements using it both day and night. I would NOT repurchase.",0
"I have been using this for years and I love it. It isn’t greasy, nor does it dry out your skin. My skin gets dry during the winter and semi-oily during the summer, but this daily moisture is perfect year-round.",2
I thought for sure walking into Sephora that I would purchase the Original flavor of this sleeping mask in the pink container...but holy moly does the apple lime one smell AMAZING. I had to get it. This mask has been a fun addition to my nightly skincare routine. It’s been about a week since I began using it and I have noticed a definite difference in the quality of lips. Recommend! Am excited to try other scents/flavors in the future.,1
"luxurious feel and it tingled a little bit for a few minutes after applying which really indicates the effectiveness. onlly need a little bit so it will last, but still a pricey item. it really made my eye look supple. i might want to use daily but dont need it, so for the price i wont use daily",1
super nourishing and feels very nice! i would say its better than the sleeping mask and i love how it comes in a tube!,1
"this is a great product and i feel the time it lasts makes up for the price. it doesnt leave me oily, it helps heal my sunburns, and i feel great that its eco friendly that alone to me is a great reason to get into the product.",1
"Gifted by Fresh. This Black Tea Anti Aging Moisturizer has a thick, gel like consistency. It feels very luxurious on the skin and has a wonderful smell. It leaves my skin very moisturizer without clogging the pores.",2
"Purchased this product on my own, so this is my honest review: Delightful scent, smooth application, a real treat for nighttime moisture. It’s not often that a product actually brings me joy, but I loved everything about this face cream. My face felt softer and more supple after using it for a month. And the floral scent makes me feel luxurious. Highly recommend.",2
I have been using this daily for a little over 4 months now and i love it. I use this every morning to help calm down any redness i have. It doesn’t make all the redness in breakouts go away but diminishes the redness around them making my breakouts less noticeable. This product is something i will continue to use because i love how well it works to calm the overall redness in my face. My skin can be really sensitive because i use a prescription retinod and this serum is so gentle that it never bothers me even when my cheeks are sensitive from using my retinod. I actually keep this serum in the fridge because it feels great in the morning using this when it’s cold.,2
"My cousin uses this product she says it work for her, but personally it ruined my skin. Ended up covered in acne. YTTP may be too vegan for me….",0
"Feels thick but it doesn’t break out my sensitive (occasional cynic acnes) skin. Stays moist throughout the night, thus it feels really hydrated in the morning. It is pricey - but and it lasts long",2
"This mighty blue oil promises much and delivers! Soothing and spa-like, tit absorbs leaving the skin smooth and radiant. No adverse side effects as with so many other retinol products. Each Sunday Riley product is better than the last!",2
I received a 7 day sample of the double serum complete anti-aging concentrate. The fruit and avacado old make it smell amazing! My face feels smooth and soft and overall looks better.,2
"What a fantastic no spill and fuss. just take a pinch rub with water and got a unique bubble paste, then massaged in circular motions over a freshly cleansed face. It cleanses your face and removes all dirt and dead skin. It’s a very gentle exfoliator that can be used daily. This product’s formula is very unique. It is a very fine white powder.  the product has very small and fine exfoliating granules that feel very soft, smooth, and gentle on the skin. complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling",2
I love this product!! I have oily skin and since I started using this my skin has balanced out and become a lot more normal! Definite must!,2
"Love this product, it took me about a month of consistent use to see a difference in my skins texture & 2 months in slowly removing scar spots. I always return to this product, my only concern is that I feel like it enhances skin sensitivity over time.",2
"I love this stuff! It’s smells amazing and it makes my skin feel great, while keeping my makeup in place.",2
Love that this serum has vitamin c in it! I haven’t had the chance to use it for an extended period of time but so far have no complaints on this product! The packaging is very sturdy but I had no idea how to use the essence. The product was extremely difficult to get out. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,0
"i have received a sample size of CLINIQUE Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting serum from topbox in exchange for my honest review. It is very rich, a little goes a long way which I really like.I felt my skin hydrated nicely. It smells great. I would like to use it more to see the long term benefits. Since my skin is very dry this serum would really help.",2
"Um Okuurrrrr. Drink Elephant nailed this one! I actually only used it one night so far, so I can’t give a long term review but it DID significantly diminish some left over swelling from acne I had picked and just looked so much better in the AM! I know retinol works more in the long run but whatever else is in hur helped me overnight. I’ll edit my review in two weeks!",2
"Anti- Aging,  Hyaluronic acid helps re- plump your skin.  I use it twice a day prior to moisturizer.  It helps with fine lines on your for head.",2
Using this everyday and I love... gives a nice glow but very subtle.,2
"This made a nice foam, rinsed off easily, and removed waterproof mascara without too much running. I received this in a gift set but would purchase.",2
"At first, I was unsure of how the product would work because I’ve had a few bad experiences with other products but had never tried Ester Lauder. I was very surprised . After the first application, I was pleased.My skin soaked it up and it felt great. It isn’t greasy, heavy or shiny. It absorbs quickly. My skin now has more glow and no dryness. The scent is pleasant and I use it every night. I’ve noticed in the mornings that I don’t have puffiness like I used to.My wrinkles are less significant which is a major plus. I can’t wait to see how it progresses as I continue to use this product.",2
Received a deluxe sample of this product and was amazed at how well it works!  My skin feels amazingly smooth and clean every time I use it. I also noticed that I’ve had no breakouts since using it.,2
"The packaging alone is 5 stars. When I say this is the most immaculate jar and packaging I’ve seen from a cosmetics brand...I won’t even through the empty jar away when I’m done, I’ll just leave it displayed for elevate a space. Now, for the cream itself: it’s ok. My skin is already pretty balanced from my skin care regimen, but I would say that it fits well into it, I can swap this for my regular cream and it still maintain the same hydration. If you’re looking for something that’s going to hydrate and plump and haven’t found it yet, definitely try this.",1
I ended up giving it to my mom because it was more beneficial for her and she likes it. She said it makes her dark circles less and skin moisturized,1
These are amazing if you have the occasional blemish. They absolutely decrease the life of the blemish on your skin.,2
This is such a beautiful oil. I wish this would be for morning use too! Helps recover my skin over night and makes it look so youthful! I love it! I have super dry skin and this helps a lot!,2
"Love this stuff! It keeps my lips moist until I eat or drink it off. No taste, which is good imo. It’s smooth & creamy, not waxy. For me it works great overnight.",2
It may work for much smaller pimples than what I had. Definitely not working for me. Waste of money!!!,0
"I wanted to love this so badly but this mask, in addition to the Banana Bright Face Primer, gave me a rash all over my cheekbones which NEVER happens. I do not have sensitive skin and I use AHAs and BHAs a lot. So if anything like that ever happens to you, proceed with caution. Loved it on the rest of my skin but not worth to have to avoid two big sections of my face.",1
"I can’t say enough good things about this oil! I initially tried it to help my skin which gets dry and tight in cold weather. Not only did it relieve the dryness and discomfort, the oil also improved the overall tone and texture of my skin! I noticed visible improvements within a week of applying both morning and night. It soaks in so well that I have no issues applying moisturizer and then makeup over top.",2
"Currently on my third bottle! This is one of my go-to’s, the last step to my skincare regimen. I alternate between this squalane oil and the oil from Kora Organics, both products make my skin glow. I use this during the morning (three drops for my face and neck) and at night (five drops for face and neck). I haven’t gotten any breakouts.",2
So so so so so yes. I don’t think I’ve ever found a product that both moisturizes and fights acne it’s like you get one or the other never both and I swear it’s life changing. And the best part is you can use it everyday twice a day or like once a week and either way it does amazing.,2
I recieved a free sample of this serum and it was so effective! It left my skin feeling smooth and fresh! I am looking to invest in this product soon.,2
I have been using this over a year now and it’s the best thing I ever added to my skin care routine. I use it everyday and make me feel so freshened up and cleanse my skin well,2
"If you have eczema or dry skin or redness due to dryness, this is the moisturiser for you. I think this is my 4th tub ordered so far not to mention the mutiple small tubes I have in my car, purse, office, everywhere. This is better on the face than the first aid face 5 in1 cream. If you want SPF just add an SPF lotion that you like and layer it on top of the ultra repair cream, that is how fast this cream absorbs.Even foundation goes on smoothly on top of this cream. I will buy it forever.",2
i love this lip balm so much! the price might be deceiving but it’s worth every last dollar. i’m gonna go get ever single one they make now lol. only lip product that helps ur lips heal fast tbh. i’m literally in luv,2
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I used the ANR serum for the first time a couple of years ago and loved the luxurious feel, it’s unlike anything I have ever used. It’s even better now, with the Chronolux™ Power Signal Technology, which helps increase the skin’s natural ability for visible self-repair, with in vitro testing showing it promotes skin’s natural renewal of vital new cells and boosts its natural production of collagen.I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin after three weeks of use. I have been battling with uneven skin tone around my upper cheekbones area and it is finally evening out:) I also noticed my skin looks more radiant, like a nice glow from within look. I will definitely love to purchase the serum but it’s too expensive so I will have to save up before I make a purchase (Ladies, we’ve to glow up responsibly). Overall, it does what it claims so I give it a strong 4 (it would be a 5 if the bottle was bigger and affordably priced).",1
"Now this product is good, however, for the price I would not buy it. I’ve come across just as good exfoliators for much better prices. It left my skin nice and soft and it has a gentle grade of physical exfoliators.",1
I absolutely love this cleaner on my face it leaves my face feeling really refreshed and it washes off my make up better thank any facial cleaner I have used.,2
As soon as I placed this on my face I immediately felt it tightening up in a good way. It has a nice soft smell. After a month of using this product I do feel a firmness on my face. The elasticity on my face has increased and I’m i. Love,1
I’m disappoint that this didn’t work for me. I don’t feel like my face is moisturized and gives that look of a moisturized face. But the number one problem that I have with this product is that it peels. I can’t wear make-up or a lightweight sunscreen without it peel. Thankfully I just very recently bought it and willing be returning it for something else.,0
"It definitely puts moisture back in your lips, but unlike a lot of reviews where it said it completely got rid of their chapped lips, I still had uneven lip texture and my lips would get chapped by night the next day. It doesn’t feel that much better than other lip masks I’ve tried, where I dislike how heavy it feels and the next day how my lips feel like they’re not mine. It’s a decent dupe for Bite Beauty’s Agave Mask.",1
Really cleaning my skin i love it. Its so smooth too i like it alot,2
I feel like this mask is just moisturizer. Skin doesn’t feel that different after. I’m glad I bought the smaller size instead of the large one because the large one would not be worth it’s price.,1
So happy to have to found my holy grail moisturizer. I have been using this for about a year and it’s made such a difference in my skin. I use this + the ordinary hyaluronic acid 2% and my skin has never been better. I use 2 pumps am and pm. It’s so mosturizing my skin feels amazing after applying it. Plus the packaging is so cute!,2
"After giving this a shot for a few weeks, I’ve seen a true improvement in my skin. Clearer. Smoother. Less breakouts. Give this a try!!!!",2
"I received this product from Influenster for review. I only got a very small trial size, which I used at night for about 2 weeks. I feel this product is very hydrating, and can be a good product to rehydrate dry skin. However, in combination with my serums and moisturizers I already and use highly enjoy, this fell short for me. I feel the value ultimately is not worth what’s in the bottle. Very good for dry skin, but that’s about it. The rest of the claims this product presented itself with were false for me.",0
"A little goes a long way with this. I tried it in the store and loved it, and then brought home and struggled for a bit getting the right amount to where my face was hydrated, but not greasy. About a half pump seems to be perfect, and it’s helped with the redness and uneven skintone I’ve had issues with in the past. The hydration lasts all day, and my skin looks matte and radiant all day!",2
C.E.O Sunday Riley comes in luxury packaging.The box is so nicely designed to keep the product safe and inside is the pump bottle which I love for this kind of serum.Sunday Riley contains 15% of brightening Vit C serum which is the standard quantity to enhance and brighten complexion.The product smells like fresh oranges but the scent is very mild.I personally love fresh Orange scent.This is formulated to fight signs of aging like dullness and dark spots.I instantly felt the skin had that youthful glow after first application.I am glad I did not experience any redness or itchiness that I had with other VitC products.This is so gentle on skin.I use it morning and night and I make sure to wear my sunscreen as I have heard skin can get more sensitive to rays after introducing Vit C.It was gifted by Sunday Riley.,2
I have oily skin that gets more dry in the winter time and this cream is my saving grace! It’s not thick or heavy but it hydrates intensively and softens my skin. The scent is so nice and relaxing! I find that it gives me a wonderful glow without ever feeling greasy. I have your the aqua bomb before for day time and then I got this one sent to me by Influenster and this is definitely THE night cream for anyone with oily skin and a day and night cream for most other skin types. I love that Belif is a clean brand and that they use herbal formulas!,2
I love it! My skin stays glowing just after the first use! Its really worth it.. i totally recommend it. If you have sensitive skin maybe its too harsh for you,2
I have incredibly sensitive skin and have been suffering lately with texture but this scrub changed my life! My skin is so smooth after using this and I haven’t had any reactions with it which is so rare!,2
I love this mask. I’m really very particular about my skincare products. And that’s one of the best masks I have ever tried. leaves my skin very soft and hydrated.,2
This mask makes my skin feel amazing! I put on a layer before bed and I wake up to beautiful and hydrated skin. I also feel like it calms the redness in my cheeks. If you have dry skin this is a must buy!,2
I love this toner. I’ve been using fenty toner and it’s nice but I felt like it didn’t do anything for my pores as far as appearance. I really didn’t want to like this toner but I love it and will be buying the full size,2
"I love this line and was hoping for more out of this. I am 63 and was excited to try a gentle and moisturizing cleanser, but it was like washing my face with rancid lard.  It left a greasy film that I had to use a scrub to get off and smelled like rancid lipstick  Good thing it was cheap because it went straight into the garbage.",0
"Bought this for my boyfriend, he loves it and is taking care of his skin well. (I’m very happy) He tried my Versed Sunscreen and say that the InnisFree sunscreen is more light and less waxy! Hope this helps :>",2
"This is not a qualitative post; I just bought this and am not sure if I like it yet (although spraying something that contains alcohol seems like a bad idea, especially around the eye area). My problem with it right now is this: the 1oz. bottle has a GIGANTIC, AWKWARD lid…Probably the same lid that is on the 3.4oz. bottle…So my question is, with a price tag like this, couldn’t Caudalie have sprung for a better fitting lid for the 1oz. bottle and not just a standard sized lid for both 1oz. and 3.4oz sizes?The thing is just comical looking on that tiny bottle. You’re better than that, Caudalie.",0
this is the best balm i’ve ever owned thus far! i binge buy balms and have tried soooo many high and low end balms. i decided to give this one a shot after reading thousands of positive reviews and it does not disappoint! this INSTANTLY treats any chapping from the cold and keeps my lips moisturized for a very long time. i’m very pleased with my purchase and will continue to purchase this product.,2
This product was free.  by Charlotte tilbury beauty and I just love the overrall packaging! So aesthetic and the actually bottle is gorgeous! It is a fragrant moisturizer. I love it so much.,2
"I wasn’t a big fan of this product until winter hit and my skin started drying out. This cream is a life saver! I use it on my face, hands, feet, elbows, knees and stomach. Gentle enough for even my super sensitive skin but strong enough to wipe out dry patches overnight. Great price for such a large jar, more than enough to last through the winter using it head to toe! Love it!",2
"First time using this product.. I love the smell! Lavender is so calming for night. The product goes a long way, and I noticed unlike some other night creams it wasn’t too thick or oily. I received this product for free testing.",1
"I am loving the results I have been seeing from this exfoliant! It smoothes out my skin and overall leaves my complexion looking more even. It foams up really nicely and a little goes a long way. I have sensitive skin and don’t find this too harsh to use on a daily basis. My only con is that it can be hard to control how much product comes out of the bottle so sometimes, if I’m not careful, I will pour out too much and end up wasting product. Overall I think this is a great choice for those with sensitive skin who want to use a physical exfoliant!",2
This product is amazing. I got a free sample of this product and I have such a hard time getting rid of my blackheads and after 2 minutes my blackheads were gone. I would highly recommend this!,2
"My skin is very sensitive but I can use it daily with out any irritation, will buy it again.",1
This product was amazing. The product left my face radiant and clean. I ran to the store right away to buy more of the product. I would recommend this product to all my friends.,2
Loved this product was very mild but removed my makeup very well. I have oily skin and I loved this product.,2
"Happy with my purchase. Makes my skin happy:) I wanted to try this product as to be honest, my usual product is a little on the pricey side. I’m not disappointed at all.",2
Every season brings new challenges with my combination skin and the Ultra Repair cream really has hit the mark. Keeps my skin hydrated when its dry and doesn’t clog my pores when its oily. I love the smell (has a hint of eucalyptus or tea tree oil) and my skin looks better each time I use it.,2
My skin looks so frekkin fresh and alive!! I used the free sample and saw immediate results? What? So obviously I bought it in that same moment.,2
I love this product. It is used to remove dark circle and lines. Also it helps with dryness and dehydration of the skin. This product is a light weight gel. It’s easy to apply. You can do it in the morning before work and again at bed. Dermatologist approved.,2
I am thoroughly enjoying this serum stick! My skin has been so dry and flakey this winter that even my moisturizer isn’t cutting it. Within two days of using this stick it is totally healed. I am wearing it today under my foundation and I absolutely love the way my foundation looks over top of it. I recieved this complimentary in an Influenster VoxBox.,2
I enjoyed this a lot! I use it at night for overnight hydration after toning and cleansing. It reminds me of drunk elephant f-balm. I wake up with glowy skin in the morning!,2
"I really am liking this mask, it effectively cleanses and I notice less appearance of pores, but I’ve used other charcoal masks from the brand and they seem to have better results. But I still would recommend this to a friend and will continue using! I received this free from Influenster to test, but all opinions are my own!",1
"Love it! You can tell that this will protect you in the sun! It left my face a little white so i wouldn’t wear this under makeup, but perfect for a sunny beach day. Smells great too!",2
"I received this product for free via Influenster for testing purposes but held off reviewing it for nearly a month to give it a fair shot and give an unbiased review. My first thought was “oh my god it smells amazing”, it smells like the most delicious lemons you’ve ever smelled. My face felt refreshed after one use and after almost a month of roughly daily use my face has a more even skin tone and a radiance that I genuinely didn’t expect to get from this product. I didn’t think I had dark spots, but it’s definitely been brightening something. The one thing about this product that concerns me is that it can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, but I can’t judge it until I’ve been exposed to more than 30 seconds of January sunlight",2
"Alternating this product and a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide has completely cleared up my skin. This product is thin but has some substance, similar to an essence. It has an ’acidic’ scent, like vinegar, and can burn or tingle a bit when you put it on. I follow with up with The Ordinary’s NMF+HA Moisturizer so it doesn’t dry out my skin. All in all I’d recommend this product as an essential part of my skincare routine at an extremely reasonable price. I hope this one never gets discontinued.",2
"This is such an amazing makeup removing balm! My makeup slides right off and provides such a soft and clean finish. I got this product to test and couldn’t wait to try it out! The texture of the product is very nice and cream-like which later turns into an oil base once absorbed into the skin, which leaves the skin feeling super soft! The size is also amazing, and would last a very long time. One star less, only because I wish the scent was a little better, but overall, this is an amazing product!",1
"Amazing!! I had really bad flaky skin and this product has done wonders. My skin feels so hydrated and soft, even my family members have noticed how healthier and hydrated my skin looks.",2
"I was scared at first to use this product cause my skin is oily. Its reduced breakouts and really moisturizes my skin! I also gave a sample to my friend who had a big red dry patch on his leg, it went away in less then 2 weeks of usage",2
This isn’t a cream nor a foundation so I found that a bit confusing. It also doesn’t seem to say on the package to apply it with a cotton pad and it’s pure liquid. I’m not really sure what it’s supposed to do but application should be more straight forward. #contest #complimentary #meetcreamskin #datenightessentials @Influensterca @laneigeca,1
Love trying different facial sprays- really enjoy this one and the perfect refreshing mist it ejects.  Great for pre and post makeup application. Would have given 5 stars but I do not love the smell- nothing bad I just like to inhale a nice scent!,1
"This is one of the best physical exfoliants that I’ve used. If you have sensitive skin, I would definitely patch test. This exfoliator combines physical and chemical exfoliation and leaves my skin feeling smooth and looking bright. I love the way this smells (like cinnamon) and will continue to repurchase this one.",2
"Received bday trial size and fell in love. Gave my skin a gorgeous glow under my moisturizer. Decided to invest just in time for the holidays so I bought (2) sets that comes with the full sized serum as well as two other Caudalie items for the same price as just the serum. $115 value! Plus bought it during the 20% off VIB sale, so im well stocked. Its worth the hype!",2
"Bought the smaller container for my first time purchasing, because it can be pricey! My face is acne prone and almost always red. I bought this in hope that it would help with the redness without feeling too much like I’m wearing makeup, because I don’t want to always be wearing makeup. It worked well for this! I only give it 4 stars because it didn’t improve my complexion or surface of my skin noticeably.",1
"I splurged on this for the fall/winter since i have dry skin  especially around my nose, mouth, and chin area (flakes like crazy!). This cream has a very elegant feel to it. It doesn’t feel greasy, sticky, or thick. It glides so smoothly onto my skin and it doesn’t just sit on top. My skin really absorbs it and looks so plump. I always had a wrinkle on my forehead that bothered me and it has minimized so much since using this. My skin has had zero flakes since using this.",2
"I absolutely LOVE how gentle the Sugar Strawberry Exfoliating Face Wash is! It’s nice to have an exfoliating product that can be used daily without damaging your skin. I also love how you know how long to work it into your skin - you just keep rubbing until all the sugar is gone! My skin is pretty normal, not super oily or dry, and I had no issues with breakouts after using this product (I don’t commonly have breakouts after using skincare products. The scent is great too! I received this product complementary in exchange for my review via Influenster.",2
I love it so much I am on my second jar! I am always scared of thick cream moisturizers because I have drier skin but anything that irritates it will cause a breakout. Before this I was just using oils but I wanted extra hydration so I took a chance on this and havent looked back (it did not irritate/break me out at all). It is so hydrating and would be better for dry or normal skin types. If you are looking for something that will continually nourish and hyrdate your skin throughout the day/night you might love this as much as I do!,2
I really liked the versatility of this mask! My first use was as an after shower moisture mask so I layered it on thick-it was almost completely absorbed after about 10 minutes a I had to do was rub in the excess. When I woke up the next morning my skin was soft and glowing. No blemishes of any kind. I also use it as a daily moisturizer using a smaller amount and I love how it works as a makeup primer! Definitely would recommend,2
"I’m obsessed with this salve - it’s multipurpose and great quality. It is so moisturizing (although a bit too oily, which I like, but some may not) and I use it for my lips mainly, and random dry patches. You can dab a bit on your cheeks for shine, and smooth it over rough cuticles to soften and protect them. This serves as a great lip-gloss too, since it’s got so much shine, but doesn’t feel like lip gloss at all. Great product - couldn’t live without it.",2
"I’m in love with this product! I’ve tried the cherry version before as well, and loved the formula & scent. Especially as someone with sensitive skin who occasionally suffers from contact dermatitis/eczema, finding a gentle and effective makeup remover has been such a struggle, but this stuff gets the job done well! And the Sweet Apple version is my favorite. PLEASE make this scent a part of your permanent collection!!",2
"I love this moisturizer; it loves my 50 year old skin.  Firstly, the automatic silky feel of my skin right after I apply it.  Second, I have combo skin and live in a climate where the weather can dip to freezing from time to time.  This is the 1st winter that I can remember when my skin hasn’t gotten dry and flaky.  Love it!",2
This is literally my holy grail moisturizer!! It has a lightweight texture to it and its reduced my pores so much!! It lasts me about 3 months and I’m on my third bottle now!,2
I’ve used this twice and am amazed at the change in my skin! My skin not only looks better but feels better. Cannot wait to see what happens after continuing use!,2
"this sunscreen is so good!! it not only does not break me out, but when applied leaves such a nice and dewy glow!! makes me look like i have glass skin fr. i totally recommend this product!",2
This is just the right amount of moisturizer for my skin. It soaks in right away and doesn’t feel greasy or leave a film at all. My dry patches stay away all day long.,2
"I’ve been using this since 2017 and it has worked wonders on my skin. Using it once in the morning after moisturizing and then alternating it at night with retinol is my bible. Especially during the summer, it helps reduce sebum and keeps my skin smooth.",2
"I have bought this product twice now, and so far have loved it. I sometimes wish it was a little stronger o ly for the fact I only wash my face in the Am when I shower.",1
I’ve never been one to wear a moisturizer. I am very oil so I’ve been scared of using them HOWEVER after researching a lot. I’ve found one that I can say I love !!! Has a very minimal scent and really light weight.,2
drys up large red pimples in a matter of nights,2
it removes makeup just as well as the normal version so it’s a very good balm.  But this has a super intense maraschino cherry scent.  if you don’t like fragrance pass on this one...,1
This Rosebud Salve lip balm is the perfect combo of chap stick and gloss. I personally don’t like lip gloss because I feel my lips lack the cure to be undried.,1
Makes your lips super soft and hydrated! Loved that you only have to put it on at night for it to work. downside is the price of the product,2
"I have combo leaning oily skin and only bought the mini size coz I was traveling to somewhere very dry. And after using it consistently I definitely noticed a difference in my skin. So supple and soft every morning I wake up. I live in south Florida so I definitely don’t use it every day now. Just every other day with a little amount to provide a little extra boost to my skin. If you use it in moderation for oily skin, kind of consider it as a Leave on mask, it will work great!",2
"This stuff is the literal goat of skin care! I was skeptical at first because I do tend to break out especially around that time of the month but this stuff was incredible! I’ve been using it for about a month now, and have noticed a huge difference in the overall appearance of my skin and it’s plump-ness. It’s improved some of my fine lines and acne scaring as well. I’ve worn it before bed and even during the day before applying my makeup and I was surprised to learn how it made my make up look so dewy. 10/10 recommend",2
I have been using this gel from Lancôme for about a month now in the mornings and before bed. My skin feels SO soft and so hydrated (even in this crazy summer weather). I think that adding this to my routine has also cut down on the oily ness of my skin too. I was fortunate enough to receive this gel moisturizer for free from Influenster.,2
"I really liked this eye cream. It’s more on the thicker side, which I liked. For me it wasn’t sticky or oily. It’s a quality eye cream!",1
This was my first product I’ve tried from the ordinary brand… and I will NEVER try anything again. This is the only product I added new to my regimen at night time right before my moisturizer… The very next day I woke up with two huge cystic pimples on my chin… stay far away from this product if you are acne prone.,0
"my lips were always dry ,tried so many lip products.BUT this is bestest lip product. i am on my 3rd container now .love love this mask ......",2
"I hate the feeling of anything heavy on my face and if you’re like me, this product is for you! It’s super light weight. Even my boyfriend who NEVER lets me put anything on his face (because he hates the feeling of it being in his face) said he didn’t feel anything. I use it as a daily face moisturizer in the morning and it does a great job of keeping my skin hydrated. When my hands gets super dry just a few drops does the job. This will last you forever! Definitely worth the price.",2
"I’ve been using this for years and it’s been an absolute miracle and I’m being honest. It is so hydrating, I love the ingredients, it’s your best friend if you’re looking for hydration. It’s a must in your skincare routine.",2
By far one of the best makeup removers I have ever used. A little amount goes a long way with this product...It takes forever to go though a container. Takes all my make up off and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.,2
"I did a Lot of research before purchasing this product... as in days reading reviews from different sites. Then, I splurged. This is by far the most expensive product I’ve ever purchased from Sephora, besides my Clairsonic. I’ve had it for a couple of weeks now, and it has already done some small things. I wouldn’t call it a miracle serum, but on the first use I did notice my skin was much softer and smoother, and my makeup went on so much easier. My skin has not been oily throughout the day, and I haven’t had any major breakouts since I started using it. Actually, I’ve been wearing less and less makeup because I notice my skin tone evening out more. I really like it, and I hope it continues to have good effects on my skin.",1
"Love this stuff. Has a great texture and finish to go under makeup. Only wish it came in a bigger jar. Pretty good price, though.",2
It’s super hydrating!!! It is good for a little refresh during the day!!!,1
This product was given to me by Influenster to try in return for a review. I tried the essence but couldn’t really tell that it did much. It provided some moisture but that’s it. it was like using water.,1
I can definitely tell that my skin is smoother and more moisturized after use. I’ve been using it once a day in my nighttime routine before my usual moisturizer. It tightens and provides the best daily hyaluronic in a bottle!,2
"I can’t believe I would spend this much money on a toner, but I’m glad I did. After few weeks of using it, I can see my skin is getting smoother and soft. However the one star less is because it goes too quick :( and I’m not really a big fan of the smell. But except that, I think I will keep saving money for the next bottle.",1
"This stuff is so expensive! I buy the smallest size, but the good thing is you only need a pea-size amount. I use it once a week (for about 10 weeks so far--still on my first small container) and I have definitely noticed that my pores have shrunk and my fine lines have become less noticeable. I manually exfoliate with it for about 1 minute and then I let it set while doing something else for 2 minutes before washing it off. It’s not too abrasive for me but I wouldn’t use it more than twice per week. I have oily/combination skin. I haven’t experienced any breakouts with this product. I’ve had perioral dermatitis in the past and I am very pleased that I’ve had no reactions to this product. My mom who just turned 60 has been using this product for about 6 months and loves it! She encouraged me to try it myself. She uses it twice/week. She also has oily/combination skin and looks very youthful and glowy! I will definitely keep purchasing this! Maybe someday I’ll take the plunge to buy a bigger size lol. Try it! You won’t be disappointed.",2
"The best cleanaing balm! I Love it, its so easy to remove and cleans the skin perfectly",2
This did tighten my pores and smooth my undereye area pretty well but it irritated my jawline and cyctic acne. I think this is best used on the T-zone and undereye area for best results. At least for my skin personally. But for the amazing undereye results alone its worth it!!!,1
"This product from dermalogica is amazing! It foams up lovely and it does not strip the skin. I also have dry, acne prone skin and this did not dry out by skin, as well as not cause any breakouts. Received complimentary from Dermalogica.",2
I used it twice a day and the bottle didn’t even last 2 months. I didn’t notice any improvement in my skin.,0
This product smells great and keeps my face moisturized and helps get rid of dry patches on my face,1
"I’ve tried about every eye cream/moisturizer out there, and either had disappointing results or irritation of my sensitive eye area. This stuff makes my eyes feel wonderful, and it actually is making the lines in that troublesome area just above the crease disappear, so my shadow looks smooth and pretty again. I don’t feel dry and taut by the end of the day, but it never, ever pulls off my eye makeup. It’s like a miracle.",2
"It’s okay. Face feels a little tight after using it and after a month of consistent use saw no difference in skin texture. The moisturizer works well with this to balance out the tightness, but it just cleaned my face.",0
I love that this moisturizer is for any skin type. I have dry skin & it hydrated my skin well. I will definitely be repurchasing this moisturizer again.,2
Balked at purchasing this for years due to the cost but finally had to try it because I had developed rosacea that made me desperate enough to try it.  It is beyond amazing. Makes my skin so soft and the fragrance is delightful. My skin is so smooth and the fine lines in my forehead are barely detectable now.  If always had dry skin and had just gotten worse with age. At 47 I’ve finally found my skin savior.,1
At first I was sceptical but it improve my skin so much. It reduce most of my dilated pores. I have less black head when I use this product.,2
I love this face mask I was sent this from Influenster. I have sensitive skin and this was so light an refreshing. My skin looked flawless right after no drying and no harsh smell or burn! I highly reccomend.,2
"Fixes my chronic dry lips immediately. Stays on all night, good weight feeling, not oily, not sticky, smooth texture, no odd taste noticed. next morning my lips are smooth, look even, not painfully split. A small amount goes a long way. This jar will last a longggg time.I even used it during the day during the short winter months in FL looks like a gloss.",2
"Amazingly refreshing, makes skin feel soft and sprays well. My entire family loves this! I use it everyday at least twice a day.",2
This stuff is heaven in a pot.  I suffer from chronic dry cracked lips.  I’m also a chronic lip licker which leads to more chapping.  I have a nervous habit of biting my lips as well.  I put this stuff on tonight for the first time and heard angels sing.  I’ve tried ever lip salve there is.  Like another reviewer said a lil bit goes away.  It’s moisturizing but locks it on your lips as well.  So I don’t feel the need to lick. Will deff be reordering,2
Worth the price? No. These wipes smell great and take off your makeup but they do the same thing as a normal drugstore makeup wipe. They also are smaller then a normal makeup wipe! I personally won’t be buying again.,0
"Lovely feel! I use this at the end of my nighttime skincare routine and by morning my skin is smooth and glowing! Thick consistency, but Highly recommend.",2
This is one of my new favorite skin care products! It’s so easy for your skin to absorb. I noticed my skin has become more hydrated and softer since my first time using this product! It also helps my serum absorb so much better. I have very sensitive skin and it reacted so well to the product. Highly recommend!,2
"I am 43 yrs old and have tried dozens of facial cleansers, but this one is the only one that completely removes dirt and make-up. It’s non-drying and makes my face feel cool and refreshed.",2
"I recently received this product in a Voxbox free for review. I have a minimalist skincare routine and typically don’t wear foundation. I have very pale skin, and my cheeks very often get red and splotchy. I have a hard time finding foundation to cover it, as every color usually comes up orange on me.This product fixed that problem. It went on green and then transitioned to a neutral light beige color and did a wonderful job at hiding the redness in my cheeks. Ive been wearing it every day for about a week now and I love how even my skin looks throughout the day. The texture I would say is a little like lotion. It feels a little bit heavy at first (no heavier than foundation or some primers) but it is very comfortable on the skin. I also like that it has SPF in it, as my skin doesnt do very well in the sun, and any protection I can get makes me happy. I also have very sensitive skin that gets very angry with pretty much anything I stick on my face, and Ive found that so far this and the rest of the Cicapair line have been wonderful and have not irritated it so far so thats a huge plus. Overall, at least for paler skin, I would say that this is an awesome product that is well worth a try if you have redness or blotchiness. Im not sure how well it would transition on darker skintones though.",2
I’m normal to oily skin and this serum really leaves my skin dull all day,2
"I wasn’t sure what to expect with this cream, but it was nice. A little bit goes a long way and it made my skin look better.",1
I really really liked this dermalogica daily exfoliant. Didn’t expect much but a harsh exfoliant but it was the opposite! Just from the first use my skin felt different and cleaner. My skin looked brighter and felt softer. Make up went on amazingly after. I also liked the consistency of it and was easy to use. Received this complimentary from demalogica.,2
"While I liked this product, I didn’t think it was any better than the Maelove Niacinamide I use. It calmed my skin, and I liked the subtle scent (like jolly ranchers!), but it didn’t give me any glow or dewiness. I would consider switching once I finish my Maelove though.",1
"I have super dry skin and this worked like a charm! I use it just before going to bed when my skin and looking sad and dead and when I wake up my skin is radiant, luminous, gorgeous. People have literally come up to me after I’ve used this mask and said my skin was a-glowin!!",2
"I have combination skin, so I stay away from my oily t-zone and only apply a small amount to my cheeks, neck, and under eyes. I noticed a difference in my skin after first use. The hype is absolutely real with this! The tube comes with A LOT of product. No noticeable scent, just an awesome hydrating formula that can be washed off or left on the skin. 10/10 recommend. Love this stuff.",2
"As a lover of glycolic acid peel pads, I was thrilled when GOOP gifted me their GOOPGLOW 15% Glycolic Acid Overnight Glow Peel!My box arrived kind of beat up, but the pads were unharmed in their easy to open foil envelopes. Each pad is soaked in plenty of product, with a textured exfoliating side and a soft cotton side. They also have a little pocket to slip two fingers in to help with application. You apply this product once a week, at night. It leaves a definite sticky feel to the skin, which disappears by morning. You are also able to apply moisturizer after letting the acid sit on your skin for 15 minutes.The result: Amazingly soft, bright skin! I couldn’t stop looking at it or touching it!",1
"I love this oil! I do have combination skin so I was a little weary of using a beauty oil for my face. I can honestly say I have noticed a huge difference in my skin since applying this nightly for about 8 weeks now. I tend to get dark marks and this has done wonders to eliminate and diminish them. I have noticed a difference in fine lines as well (I am young but was concerned with some that were popping up). It is a bit too oily for me to use during the day, but it will remain a nightly routine for me!",2
"I have oily and very acne prone skin. I usually use the Josie Maran argan oil bc I find oils make my skin produce less of it’s own and keep it bump and breakout free. After using an spf that broke me out horribly, I purchased this oil. It’s a miracle! My skin had already started clearing in just a few days. The only reason I didn’t give it five stars is bc I don’t line the smell at all. It’s tolerable for how well it works though.",1
"Love this cleanser! It smells lovely and leaves my skin truly clean without stripping or drying; it also lathers really nicely, which isn’t always a guarantee with clean products. I’m 48 with sensitive skin (touches of rosacea), and this feels incredibly soothing. I also love the packaging: The bottle is glass, and one pump is the perfect amount.",2
"Love this mist! I spray this generously after I shower and pat dry my face, then I let my face air dry. My redness is immediately reduced. Great prep before I add my skincare. I got my friends addicted too. Must have in everyone’s skin routine!",2
"This is by far my favorite moisturizer. I honestly see the difference in my skin and i’ve noticed a huge improvement in regards to texture. I had a lot of dents on my skin from acne and i think this has really resurfaced my skin in combination w the other products I use because they are completely gone. My only complaint is that this does not last me a long time at allllll. im already on my third bottle and my pocket hurts, it doesn’t bring a lot.",1
"This product smells great and feels great on my skin. After cleansing when my skin feels dry, applying this makes my skin feel smooth and hydrated.  I received this product free from Influenster to review, but all opinions are my own.",1
"Smaller than expected, 4“x5“ wipes.... entire mini package fits in palm of your hand. Toss it in your makeup bag or clutch purse. On foundation free days, these are great to refresh your face throughout the day. Especially in Texas heat!",1
Great product but leaves a sticky finish at first but disolves eventually,1
I really like and enjoy using estee lauder products and this eye creme isnt the exception. Feels so good in my under eyes,2
I love Peter Thomas everything. I could do this everyday,2
"It is so amazing, I love it!I could see & feel the difference right away!",2
"This is the product for all my fellow dry skinned people. This is the first cleanser I’ve found where my skin is left clean but not stripped. It works well for a morning single cleanse and also as a first step for double cleansing at night. The scent is pretty neutral, and not having any added fragrance helps make this ideal for sensitive skin. I do massage the tube before use since the product can separate, but it’s a small complaint compared to the benefits my skin has seen. Will repurchase!",2
"I am absolutely loving this new serum! I’ve been using it daily, both morning and night. It has a perfect milky texture that doesn’t feel sticky or tacky. It leaves my skin feeling so nice and bouncy!",2
"I received a trial size in one of my boxes and I fell in love. I’ll definitely be purchasing the full size. The name is very fitting as it’s truly clear. No white cast whatsoever and none of that nasty sunscreen smell. I’m normal to dry and this didn’t leave me dry or greasy, just super smooth. No breakouts and didn’t pill over moisturizer (even when applied directly after). Primer didn’t pill over it either. Makeup went well over it so it works well as a primer too. It’s not difficult to remove, and I just can’t say enough good things about it.",2
"these are really great. I have been struggling with unusual acne breakouts for quite a while now, ever since i had to stop using Rodan and Fields. In the past two weeks since i have been using these, my skin has cleared significantly. I use them in the morning as my face cleanser. trust me, it was kinda weird only using these to wash my face (I have struggled with oily skin and acne for most of my life) but they really are all you need.",1
"if you’re looking for something really exfoliating, something that’ll get into your pores and leave your skin looking brand new, this ISN’T the product for you. it’s nice, but its not worth the price. there are other cleansers that will do a better job at a cheaper price, this is all hype.",0
Decent but for some reason if there is just one drop of water on my eyes when applying it becomes really slippery and dry and not easy to apply or hydrating at all,0
it’s make my skin like a glass. this is the skin care that you have to buy! you aren’t regret it later on. look at my skin in the picture. that the first time i was trying use the product.,2
"This cream is so great, I tried a sample purely out of curiosity and wow I’ll be buying the full size. What makes this so special is that is fantastic for a daytime moisturizer! When they say it helps prep for makeup they’re not kidding. I live in a climate that demands a daytime moisturizer and this is the one! I’ve tried many many many other creams and this is the only one thats not too heavy yet my skin feels hydrated but not slippery or shiny. This is a really great find, try a sample and you’ll be changing your day cream I promise you that.",2
I’ve been using this product for about 3 days before going to bed and I’ve noticed a HUGE difference. My lips don’t feel as dry anymore throughout the day and they feel so soft!! I also noticed a reduction in the fine lines on my lips. Highly recommend this product!!,2
Love it! I love the feeling of it and the texture. It isn’t too heavy works great for me,2
"This is an excellent, almost essence like moisturizer. The texture is very thin and light, almost drippy. I find it really quenches my skin and is a nice additional to both my daytime and nighttime routines. I can see how some would find the scent a bit overwhelming but I think it is pleasant and dissipates rapidly.",2
Doesn’t make your skin feel like it’s going to crack. I didn’t find it drying at all which is a nice change! Received complimentary,1
"A game changer. I’ve used many Vitamin C serums and products, but nothing has worked the way Caudalie’s viniferine science and technology has! This serum applies silky smooth, leaving your skin looking and feeling soft and visibly brightened. Over time, I have noticed and photographed visible results, revealing a brighter and more even complexion. I enjoy the simplicity and effectiveness of this formula. I hydrate my skin with the Caudalie grape water before application and use even less product while achieving incredible results!",2
"Great peeling gel, very gentle on skin but gets the job done!",2
My favorite cleanser! A little goes a long way. I use it in the morning and at night and it always leaves my skin looking smooth.,2
"I received this product from influenster in exchange for my honest review. It actually came at a great time because my old eye cream was running low & just not doing what I needed it to. I’ve been suffering from some horrible allergies and my skin and puffy under eyes have felt it. This really helps soothe my poor skin. It’s a great consistency & really soaks in over night. I don’t use it during the day, but a little went a long way for me at night and seemed to help with my puffiness. I actually may make this a staple in my routine.",2
"So, upon receiving this I noticed the ingredient list is full of SKIN FRIENDLY ingredients. I have extremely sensitive skin so looking for a cleanser that doesn’t do more damage than good is CRUCIAL. It smells amazing. Once applied it’s extremely creamy",1
Fantaistic！easy remove make up foundation！,2
Complimentary from Sunday Riley. Haven’t noticed much difference with my puffy eye bags or dark circles. But it is very hydrating. Help my makeup go on smoother and does not irritate. This doesn’t cause millia either so that’s a plus,1
"I’m so impressed. I have dry and sensitive skin and this is the first product I found that has truly gotten rid of all of my bumps and texture. I’ve been using this almost every night for about a month now, and my skin became baby smooth!!! I’ve tried many other glycolic acids in the past and I’ve always had issues with the formula being too harsh and too sticky and breaking me out. This leaves you with no stickiness whatsoever, and the tingling/burning sensation is pretty mild and goes away after a couple of minutes. With this price, you cannot beat it. Just buy it, trust me.",2
"love how this makes my skin feel! I put it on at night and wake up with hydrated, plump, smooth skin. it’s absolutely lovely, I only wish it wasn’t so heavily fragranced.",1
I love the Belif Aqua Bomb Sleeping Mask so much I decided to give this a try. Unfortunately it leaves my skin dry and makes my makeup uneven. I wanted to love it but it just wasn’t that great.,1
"I really love the feel of this sunscreen.  It’s also my husband’s favorite sunscreen because it leaves no cast; anything that is remotely white usually gets stuck in his stubble a little and you can see the white.  It does, however, burn my eyes a little.  I also used it on my son one day and the skin around his eyes got pretty red and puffy. I still use it and repurchase it, but I do wish it didn’t bother my eyes so much.",1
"I like this a lot. The consistency is a tiny bit sticky, but it’s not too noticeable. I mix this in with my moisturizer and it’s helped my skin so much. I see a real difference when I stop using it. I’ve used this and a combination of CeraVe, Aquaphor, and Vaseline, and it’s helped eczema patches heal without the use of steroidal creams. I buy this over and over and over. The price is good and the quality is great.",2
"This works perfectly at removing all makeup, even waterproof makeup! I received this as a sample and will definitely purchase once I’m done with it!This cleansing balm is the saint twin sister to Clinique’s Take the Day Off Cleansing Oil. If you’ve tried the cleansing oil version and hated it, the balm version will pleasantly surprise you. It’s not irritating to the eyes at all and it actually removes everything! It makes up for everything the oil lacks.It spreads easily and you actually do not need much balm to remove everything, so the product will last you a while. I got a mini sample and I think I can get quite a few more uses out of it.This is the best thing I’ve ever used to remove makeup. Better than any cleanser, oil, or wipe I’ve tried. It also leaves your skin feel smooth after you’ve rinsed off and it does not make your skin feel tight at all. It feels so light on the skin and there’s no weird oily film after it’s rinsed off.A must have for any makeup user.",2
Love this! I have huge pores on my nose and chin. I also have expression lines. I have noticed my pores are a lot smaller. Black heads are going away. I also notice my lines not being so noticeable. It’s not drying at all either. I noticed a more healthy complexion the next morning too. Pretty amazing stuff really.,2
I really do not think this is any better than using vaseline overnight.,0
"It certainly does its job. If you want MATTE, get this product. I just did not like it because it was toooo MATTE. Would love to see a product between this one and their other cc cream. It did dry out my face so if you have very oily skin, this is the product for you.",1
LOVE THIS! I love the look of lip gloss but HATE sticky lips. This gloss gives shine and a hint of color with no stickiness. The scent is light and fruity. Definitely buying more,2
I have been using this product for about 7 months and I love it. I was very skeptical at first because I was afraid it would make me breakout but it never did. I typically put it on my face and neck right after the shower and it has aided in making my skin smoother and healthier looking. I will definitely be using this product for a long time!,2
"NOT GOOD AT ALL SAVE YOUR MONEY! I bought this due to hearing so many good things as I have dry skin. this does NOT hydrate at all. within the 1st 10 minutes of having it on, my skin got dry.  after only using it for 3 days my skin around my mouth got flakey. please save your money",1
I’ve had this product for a while and every time i use it it leaves my chapped lips feeling great! i don’t have the lip mask just this. i love the way it feels it’s not sticky and the smell isn’t strong but nice and subtle. however it isn’t tinted on my lips which is fine . it still passes as a gloss!,2
"The Peach lol balm smells absolutely amazing! Super creamy and easy to apply. I don’t prefer lip balms in this format, but picked this up on a whim. The lip balm itself is pretty moisturizing, but seems to fade pretty fast so I find myself having to reapply frequently.",1
I did have high expectations because of the price tag but it is just sunscreen. There is no smell which is great but maybe I am not a fan of the stick for the face. It is easy to carry in your purse but typically I put my sunscreen on during my makeup routine. I gave it 4 stars because this is great for my surgery scars. I have to use a stick for those. Don’t know if the price tag is worth it but over time I may see a difference. If you like the stick application. The unscented alone is worth it. I received compliments of Influenster for a contest and the opinions are all my own,1
"This clear sunscreen stick is awesome! First of all, I love the smell of it. It has such a smooth texture that it just glides on the face. I don’t feel greasy after applying it. Super easy to use and perfect size to throw in a bag or purse to take anywhere.",2
"Instantly plumps and smooths the skin. Leaves you looking fresh, dewey, and moisturized without feeling sticky or heavy. A few drops is good for the whole face, and you can see an instant difference. (received for testing purposes)",2
"This stuff feels soooo good on the eyes. I have very dry eyes and this not only brightens them and tightens the wrinkles, but it hydrates the skin. That’s SUPER important because my concealer can’t set properly if my skin is dry there. I’ve used a few eye creams, but this one is my favorite so far. I’ll be back for more!",2
"I’m so happy I got to try this product! It’s amazing, and a new staple of my skin care routine. I’ve used it for about 3 weeks now, and my skin feels so much more hydrated and soft. It always leaves my skin looking so radiant and works perfect with my moisturizer. Definitely try it, it’s worth the money!It’s also cruelty free, and dermatologist tested, sensitive skin safe. The packaging is also adorable, and elegant.",2
I love this product. It has little needs that gently exfoliate. No harshness. I like the smell although I know some people don’t.,2
I love this product for my dry sensitive skin. Very gentle but my skin has never looked better! The glow is real! Would definitely recommend.,2
This lip sleeping mask is so great and feels so good on the lips I’m completely addicted! I’ve been through many little jars over the years and won’t stop using it. It lasts a very long time too!,2
Smells wonderful. Skin feels very clean and “tight“ after use.,1
"I have average, fair skin with some oily patches. I started using the Alpha Beta Peel to minimize my pores and help with fine lines. I went through the first box I bought - I liked the way my skin felt, I was pleased with the results...and then I ran out. Well...I REALLY noticed a difference when I stopped using the peel. I am hooked now. I try not to use them every day, because I feel like I can get away with every other, or a few times a week - but what a difference! My pores really are minimized, my skin instantly feels better - and I always finish up by swiping the backs of my hands to treat them too. Love it!",2
I was super excited for this product! I know that glow recipe is an awesome brand and their products are always so nourishing and hydrating on my skin! My skin drank up this one! Even though I have oily skin I need to maintain a moisture barrier and stay protected from the sun and this helped to do that,2
"I got the mini size to test out about two months ago, since I had heard so many good things about this cleanser and wanted to see what the hype was about.Pros: It is very gentle. I don’t wash my face in the morning, but if you do, this is a nice gentle option that won’t make your skin feel stripped and dry first thing in the morning. It has a light, non-perfumey fresh scent; this might sound weird, but it smells like a green smoothie. Either way, it’s a nice scent that is not harsh at all.Cons, and why I won’t be buying the full size: It is very gentle. If I put makeup on, I double cleanse in the evening and I’ve found that this cleanser is not enough to completely get off any extra makeup or residue left from the cleansing balm. I have to triple cleanse in the evenings after washing off makeup, if I’m using this cleanser. For the price, I want this to be able to at least get leftover makeup off my face after already going in with a cleansing balm and this cannot do that.Overall, it is a very nice gentle cleanser and I do like using it when I’m not washing off makeup. I just personally don’t like having multiple cleansers when I know I can get one that does it all, and at a cheaper price point (I’ve used the La Roche Posay Toleriane foaming cleanser and the Simple Moisturizing Gentle cleanser and both are great options, get makeup off perfectly fine, and are at most groceries and drugstores).",1
This toning solution is very gentle yet super effective! I feel a difference already! I only use it at night then I use The Buffet Serum after,2
With all the mask wearing and working with one on 8-9 hours a day I needed some relief! It took a little over a month for my skin to stop purging and start loving this product. Stick with it and I promise it’s worth it!,1
"This was the first Farmacy product I ever bought, and I have not regretted it. I have sensitive skin, so I was a bit worried about the burn/tingle at first. There is a slight tingle, but it gets better the more you use this product! The first night I used it, I woke up with the silkiest and softest skin I have ever had in the morning. I recommend this to EVERYONE with dull skin! With sensitive skin, I only use this 2-3 nights a week.",2
this scrub is phenomenal. yes it balls up all weird but it’s literally supposed to. if you watch the demo video for this she says it will ball up (your dead skin is what is balling up) its a very gentle yet effective scrub that has not irritated my skin once and it also smells great. haven’t had a single issue with it. I have noticed a difference in my skin texture definitely.,2
Love it! It’s a deep clean but not hash on the skin at all. I follow it with Tatcha water cream and my skin hasn’t feel this great in a long it.,2
"My skin looks great when using this cleanser, but it definitely feels more dry. I’m therefore not able to use this product in the winter. The bottle also unfortunately leaked, so some of the product was wasted. Would give 5 stars if the packaging was fixed and the formula was a bit more hydrating.",1
"I really wanted to love this product but, this just don’t do it for me. I never felt like it “cleaned” my skin and I needed more product than usual to wash my face.",0
"haven’t really used many types of eye cream but I loved this one! it’s very moisturizing, great for sensitive skin, and has a good smell (that isn’t too harsh/filled with chemicals) also love the packaging!",2
"I have rosacea, and this is gentle yet effective for exfoliating my sensitive skin. I use it twice a week, and it leaves my skin soft, and my makeup applies so much better after I use it.",2
These are amazing! I used 1 time and noticed a huge difference! Will definitely buy again!,1
Amazing product. Me and my 2 daughters love this product. It’s safe and gentle on the skin and removes all the makeup after first cleanse with very small amount . I even give my 9 year old daughter this product to use and it’s safe even on her gentle skin. I will never stop buying First Aid beauty products .,2
I got a sample of from Sephora and it’s just alright. I do feel like it exfoliates the skin and it’s definitely not as strong as other acid toners I’ve used in the past like the Tarte Knockout and the GlamGlow Supertoner. I think it’s in the nice middle spot where it’s not too gentle but you still feel like it does something. The reason why I don’t really like it and I won’t be purchasing a full size version of this is because it feels soapy on the skin. When I put it on a cotton pad it kind of feels like a surfactant which is very strange to me and I don’t like that feeling. Your probably thinking maybe you have residual cleanser on your face but i only use this toner once a day and I always cleanse my face in the shower to make sure that I throughly wash my cleanser of my face so I don’t really know why I get that soapy texture on my skin I just know I don’t like it and this is a pass for me.,1
"I use it morning and night - it’s hydrating and calming esp. I have very reactive skin (it gets red and itchy easily) and this one really helps alleviate my concerns. Also, I really don’t like fragrance on my skincare and thank god this one doesn’t have smell so its good for sensitive/reactive skin. If you want a thicker cream at night, it might not be for you cause its very lightweight so I only use it on summer days.",2
I have purchased this lip balm numerous times now. I really enjoy it.,1
I really like this toner. I use it after washing my face before bed and before I do my makeup in the morning. It makes my face feel refreshed and energized.,1
"I have tried so many toners in my lifetime and nothing compares to this one. It soothes the skin and hydrates. My skin is extremely sensitive and acne prone, so the fact that this has transformed my skin, its a miracle!!  Definitely going to be repurchasing this product!!",2
"Sweet candy is just like a fruit roll up! Honestly I wish they had this in every product. I love the sleeping mask because it really helps my lips stay moisturized during the winter months, and it’s nice for any other time of year honestly too. You don’t need much, and it’s very soothing on the lips, the scent isn’t too strong, and it’s very moisturizing! I’ve definitely re-purchased this, and I will continue to do that! I really wish there was a travel friendly version of this. I also really like the berry scent! Some of the scents don’t work for me, but luckily there is an option for everyone!",2
I’ve been in the market for a new sunscreen that doesn’t pill and this one is perfect for me. It’s a great primer under makeup too!,2
"I have been using this product for a few weeks, but I can say that I really like it. I recommend it 100%. You should only keep in mind that it should be used 1 or 2 times a week, preferably at night; and during the day use sunscreen.",2
"Hi you beauties, hope everyone got a shot at trying this moisturizer. I received my trial size/sample, let me tell you a little goes a long way, with me 3 little drops keeps my face healthy and nourished all day. Calmed down my irritations and dry skin, and gives you that faint smell of roses. Very light wear and lasts all day. I am thankful to of tried this product. I will definitely use it, until it’s gone! I highly recommend. Thanks Sephora!",2
This is heavy and quite truthfully there are far better oils out there. This oil caused random breakouts on my neck and face from time to time. I eliminated it after month and a half and BOOM no breakouts. Sunday Riley’s Antioxidant & Superfood Oil is has been an absolute game changer post this. I now put the Marula Oil on my cuticles and feet because I won’t let this oil get anywhere my face. Do yourself the favor and skip on buying this. Unless you want an unnecessaryoil for your toes.,0
I received a 5 ml sample in a beauty box. I love this brand and I love vitamin C serums so I expected to love this.  But it was only so-so and not particularly unique or great. Once Vit C serums were hard to find and expensive but there are so many good choices out there that I will probably skip this one based on price and consistency. Its a little sticky and I did not see or feel any difference from using it.,1
"I am loving this gentle, retinol like moisturizing creams. It feels more like a moisturizer so i use it at the end of my skincare routine on the days I am not using exfoliants to still get that gentle exfoliant benefit.",2
Honestly I don’t see any instant result but the smell and the feeling of using it just made me feel great.,1
"I’ll start off by saying how much I loved the ingredients! I was able to use this cleanser without worrying about it containing harmful chemicals etc. which does not come easy in the beauty world these days. I so happen to LOVE how it is a cream cleanser but begins to foam up. I’m usually not into cream cleansers as I feel that they just do not actually clean my skin,yet it feels like I’m just rubbing cream all over and rinsing it off,with this it foams so easily and you can feel it cleaning your pores as you go. I used my foreo luna and as always it paired amazingly! My foreo gives it that extra foaminess I’m looking for. I would definitely purchase and trust this product to actually clean my face and am so grateful I received this complimentary of influenster in my Boss Babe Vox Box!",2
"This cleanser worked for me immediately. The next morning all of the little bumps on the side of my face were gone and the zit i had was practically invisible. This truly works wonders. I do have dry skin, so i would recommend you use this cleanser with a moisturizer if you dry skin, or just in general. My only complaint is the packaging. More than half the product must’ve been wasted because product would just spill out no matter how tightly it was shut. So i got $15 worth of product wich is kind of annoying, but this cleanser works so well i’m fine with it.",1
"They pads feel great, but they leave lint and waste too much product considering the price.",1
"absolutely love Charlotte Tilbury’s  skincare! This moisturizer is very hydrating and leaves my skin so soft. It provides the most gorgeous base for her foundation (Magic is my favorite).  This moisturizer is not greasy, not too heavy - just a beautiful texture with a smooth finish. Love it so much!",2
I received this as a complimentary gift from influenster to try out and give my honest opinion this product by far my favorite it really does the work you apply at night and in the morning u can tell the difference I would totally recommend.,2
This product works well when I have a breakout and gets rid of red acne marks left behind a lot faster. I also find my complexion is brighter.,1
"I received this as part of a rewards set, so full disclosure- I only had enough to use for a week. As far as I could tell, it didn’t do anything particularly special for me. I have combination skin and it worked alright as a basic moisturizer, but definitely not worth nearly $70 in my opinion. I could buy a drugstore product for 1/3 of the price and get the same result. Perhaps if I used it longer than a week, I would’ve noticed more of a difference. As far as first impressions are concerned, I’ll pass on this.",0
LOVE LOVE This! When i first started using it was breaking out a bit because i had some very large pores that needed cleaned out!,2
Non drying need only tint bit,2
"Kind of drying initially and made me break out but the more I used it, I guess my skin got used to it? Just a reminder since it has salycilic acid already maybe go a little easy on the other skin care products - since too much can damage your skin barrier. It feels a little bit drying in all honesty so maybe moisturize after!",1
Love this so much. I have combination skin and my nose and cheeks get really dry and they hate foundation. I use this and my skin is so soft. A little really goes a long way for this and it is worth every penny. I am a budget shopper but this is my splurge and it has lasted almost a month without making a dent. Highly recommended,2
"This was recommended to me when I went to the biggest Sephora store in NYC this summer. I bought the full sized as the price was great and it does a fine job, although I’ve owned other charcoal masks from Sephora in the past that do a better job. However this one is much easier to clean off the face than some of the other heavy duty ones, but becaues it is so thin compared to the other ones I’ve tried, I noticed it stays wet longer and takes quite a bit of time to dry if I am using it in a warm humid environment. It hasn’t done much for my face overally but it has helped me get rid of some whiteheads as well as black heads in the shiny zone of my nose. I also received this product in a cute sample sized bottle in this past month’s PLAY! box which I am hoping to take with me to my conference trips.",1
"I received this complimentary from Drunk Elephant Ecomm. This is the most genius product to come out to the skincare market! Talk about preserving shelf life! I love how this product ensures that you are getting the freshest, most potent ingredients to you skin. It makes it worth the price tag!",2
"I am a specialist in skin, and I have used it for several days and I think that other vitamins C are better.  I didn’t see a super change.  the product if it has good ingredients is light.  but I don’t know if I may have to use it for more than 1 month to see results.",0
"This cleanser is for sure one of my top 3! Even when is a foam formula it doesn’t make feel your skin tight or dry. All the opposite! You can feel your skin highly nourish, hydrated and soft! I really love the sensation that this cleanser give it to my face it’s so satisfying!",2
"i absolutely love this lip mask.  i don’t just use it at night, anytime my lips are dry I’ll put this on n it moisturizes instantly",2
"I have used this product religiously for 10 years along with the 3-step system and will never stop. It’s a holy grail for me. I have oily, sensitive skin and this is the perfect product for that. I use it all year with the exception of a couple cold winter months when my skin gets somewhat dry. It’s very lightweight and feels great!",2
"I just finished one jar of the face butter, want to recommend this product because it really moisturizes my skin nicely. But I only use this in winter. I follow Korean skin care routine which I put layers of serums before applying night cream, this would be too much for summer.",1
"This didn’t do anything for me. It is green in the jar and it’s supposed to blend to skin tone and have some sort of blurring effect? All I got was grease, no blurring.",0
"I grew up on the soy face wash and when I saw they have this I needed to try it. I have been using it for about 6 months now and I love the way it exfoliates my skin, it leaves it feeling smooth and clean. For reference I have dry skin",2
"I bought this one impulsively in the checkout line, since I was wanting to try a new cleanser. I will definitely be buying this again. It is very gentle and has a pleasant cucumber smell. It doesn’t dry my skin out or irritate my rosacea.",2
"I received this item for free by Influenster, opinion is 100% my own. I had heard about this before I got it sent and i was genuinely interested in getting it, i tried it the first night and my skin instantly felt softer and hydrated i do have dry patches and i noticed in the morning that they didn’t feel too dry.  I also been using it on days where I’m not going anywhere or doing makeup and my skin just needs extra hydration. I absolutely love this product!",2
"I really enjoyed this product, my skin feels much softer after 7days. I have combo skin and this makes my skin great. Definitely recommend.",2
I think this product is ok. It works like a lip balm. I haven’t seen any significant change and continue to deal with chap lips. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to spend that much on a lip mask that acts like a lip balm or Vaseline. I probably won’t repurchase.,1
"Love love love this. Leaves my skin feeling very soft, and plump. I have oily/combo skin and it does not make my skin more oily or anything like that. I’ve noticed a difference in the texture of my skin already after a little over two weeks of use and in the fine lines of my skin. I love this stuff. I did receive it free from Influenster and tatcha but I will be buying a bottle from here on out. It’s now a permanent part of my skin care routine.",2
I absolutely love the Rosebud Salves. They come in several different flavors and go on really nicely. They are moisturizing but not goopy or sticky and they do not feel dry. I put it on at bedtime and it really makes a difference. I highly recommend them.,2
Anyone who uses prescription strength vitamin A knows how it can sensitize your skin. This stuff is amazingly soothing. It keeps my skin from drying out and soothes it when it gets irritated specially when there’s a change in my tret prescription percentage or the days I use it.,2
I received this Tacta Serum stick to try and review and was not sure what to expect. I had never heard of a serum stick before but I must say I am a fan of this. It helps to hydrate and make fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable and adds hydration to my skin. It also helps with discoloration and I can definitely see the changes happening slowly but surely. I would definitely recommend it.,1
