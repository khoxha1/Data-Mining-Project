I really like these Dr. Dennis Gross alpha beta extra strength daily peel packets. I find them very convenient to use with the towelettes. It’s a quick treatment that really gives results. I love how my skin feels so refreshed and smooth after using these. I notice how bright and clear my skin looks and it feels amazing when done.,2
I really felt the difference in 5 treatments i felt my skin got even tone.,1
"This product has singularly changed the texture and appearance of my skin. It has drastically improved my hyper pigmentation, evened out areas of redness, kept blemishes at bay, and has reduced my pore size.  You only need 1-2 drops of this morning and night and it will make such a huge difference!",2
One of the best moisturizers I’ve ever tried! I have oily skin and this skins in my skin right away and doesn’t leave my face feeling greasy.,2
"Love this! Helps remove the dead skin on a daily!! I have PCOS and have really bad hirsutism…as a long as this is part of my daily routine, it really helps clarify and remove any dullness.",1
"I’ve reordered this cleanser a couple of times now. It’s a good staple to have for sure. My skin isn’t completely clear, but it’s good for the most part. Don’t need much product to get a good lather, pump has never broken on me, and my skin feels fresh afterwards. Will continue to use.",1
"I am super hesitant to stray away from my normal toner because of my problem, acne skin but I received this from Influenster and gave it a try. At first I did not like the smell but after about a week, I got over it and it’s not the worst smelling skin care product. Even after the first use, my skin felt softer than normal and smooth. I haven’t noticed any triggering to cause acne which is really nice too! Overall, I totally recommend and I might even have to get a second bottle! I really like this toner!",2
"After hearing rave reviews for this moisturizer for years, I decided to pick it up. I’ll say it’s a good moisturizer, but idk if I agree with the hype. The consistency makes it not easy to spread, but that’s my only con.",1
I was a big fan of the night serum so I was excited to try this one as well. I definitely noticed an improvement in the fine lines under my eye nothing drastic but enough to notice. Will continue to use since it works better than most eye creams I’ve tried (and I’ve tried a lot!). I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion.,1
Love this toner! It’s the only toner I’ve used that I actually see a difference in my skin,2
"I had my doubts about this sunscreen but since using it this past month I am a huge fan, not only does it blend in with my make up well but it’s also very light weight and feels amazing on my skin. Would recommend!!!",2
"The best product to take of my makeup! It doesn’t burn the eyes, it doesn’t make the skin dry it removes everyyything! I have purchased this 3 times now and I don’t change it for anything! When I travel I take the travel size with.",2
"My new go to night cream! If you want glowing hydrated skin, this product is for you!",2
Thick but not overbearing. It has the same smell as every other product in the line but I am okay with it. I have seen better texture within my skin and I only use a pump every time. I like that it doesn’t leave a white cast too.,2
"I have combination skin live in South Texas so lots of sun and heat. So far its great under my makeup, not heavy and doesn’t leave me greasy! Still trying to figure out how to control the T zone oil but its worth the issue for clean spf coverage.",2
This product is like gold for your lips! I find my lips to feel so hydrated and healthy when I wake up in the morning. I purchased the new scents to add to my collection and will continue to repurchase so I never run out!,2
"After having tried several different salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments throughout my life, I was intrigued to try a product with a different main ingredient. I occasionally get cystic acne that takes weeks to treat with any other treatment I tried. With this product it goes down in about 2 days, which is great!! I’m giving it 4 stars because it looks like calamine lotion, I really wish it dried clear.",1
best moisturizer ever with a plus that it does miracles for eczema,2
"I got a mini size of this in a sub. I tried it 1 time and was absolutely amazed at how good my skin looked and felt. I’ve gotten many of the minis from friends that did not want it. But I finally broke down and bought the full size and the full size cleanser. My face is seriously flawless when I use this stuff! I have combo acne prone skin, but my skin has never been clearer or softer. I can go without makeup and still feel amazing! I highly recommend!",2
People have complimented my glowing skin after just one use. Been raving abt it to friends and fam and want to treat them all to this wonder in a bottle. Thank you The Ordinary!,2
"I have dry skin, and I try whatever I can to keep my skin moisturized. Some moisturizers are instantly hydrating and soothing, but doesn’t last long. Some does creates barriers that claims to keep my skin moisturizing throughout the day but most of the times it feels like a film is sitting on top of my skin for nothing. This essence however... is so moisturizing that I couldn’t believe it at first. The effect you’ll see the moment you put on will last you at least 8 hours. I can even skip my moisturizer on top when I apply this. The only thing that bothers me is odd smell, but what it does is so amazing that I don’t even care. Your skin will thank you. The moisturizing effect lasts all day, even working 8 hours a day in a super dry nasty office environment.",2
Great product! Gets all my makeup off and makeshift skin super soft. Great for travel and gets more makeup off than my previous makeup removing face oil.,2
i applied it every night on my face and on my hair after i dry my hair. i live in a very cold snowy place (buffalo nyc) so its so hard to protect the skin n hair and honestly this makes my skin feel like a baby skin after continual use and makes my hair soft as well.,2
I really liked this! I use less than a penny size it if full goes on my face. It’s taken acne off my face and I’ve only used it for 2 says,2
"I really like this cream. It’s light but it only takes a small amount to go a long way. I used it for a week and saw a little difference, it looks like I’m a bit refreshed. I don’t know if that was the goal but that is what I wound up with. It doesn’t have a funny smell but it would’ve been nice if it has some fragrance.",2
My skin turned into an oily mess plus it did break me out!,0
"I absolutely LOVE this product. I saw this recommended by  Stephanie Nicole on YouTube and thought I would try it. I have very sensitive and dry skin and this doesn’t irritate it whatsoever. I usually use it am and PM every other day depending on what other products I’m using for my routine. I went a couple of months without using and I noticed the difference. It makes pores smaller within one to two uses, for my skin. I have let a couple of friends use it and they also noticed a difference as soon as they used them. I would recommend buying a small set to try, which is what I did and I fell in love with this product and hopefully you will too!!",2
Having tried different skin care lines I was skeptical at first about this line and the price at first deterred me. When I started to use this product though my skin which is very sensitive immediately took on a beautiful glow and feel. I love this line and it is so worth the money!,2
"Im not sure if i like or not. I have dry sensitive skin , first of all i really dont like the smell...  my skin dont feel full hydrated after but only sticky.. it gives me also breakout . I only like the fresh sensation at the beginning , small hydratation , not for irritated skin and dry patch",0
"I love this product, I see a visible difference  in my skin. It makes my skin feel wonderful!",2
"I really wanted these strips to be amazing! I have pretty bad sebum buildup and was hoping that these would help clear those out. I left one on my nose and one on my chin overnight, but when I removed them, nothing happened. I haven’t used them since just because it seems like a waste!",0
"This is the only product I use between cleaning and moisturizing, and it genuinely makes my skin look the best its ever been. Makes me feel like a straight up ethereal queen sent by the gods themselves. Its also is only product that I’ve ever gone back to, and I’ve never bought the same bottle twice.",2
"I didnt think this cleanser would clear up my skin, but to my suprise it has!! The redness is gone, my skin is soft and supple, my makeup glides on. I’m using it in conjunction with Josie Maran Argan Oil (as a moisturizer) and wow...overnight i noticed a HUGE improvement in my skin!!",2
"It is alright... it feels like nothing on the face, and weird texture, smells like nothing too, you would think its very natural and light but something in it made my skin super unhappy, small red dots everywhere. I am not allergic to anything and nothing has ever done that to my face before.. i have super easy skin... this product is definitely has something that is NOT good for you",0
"This balm is excellent at removing makeup and leaving skin clean, but not stripped! Gentle and efficient.",2
"I was not crazy about this product, that I received as a complementary part of my #BeMineVoxBox from Influenster. While it did seem to pretty effectively moisturize my skin, my skin broke out and didn’t clear up until I had discontinued using it. Additionally, the packaging design felt really sub-par and was difficult to read and understand. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",0
"Ot works great! You need to double cleanse, like with every other cleanser. Removes even waterproof makeup. Leaves skin clean, not dry, and not with filmy leftover product either .  My skin feels balanced for sure!!",2
"I feel like I’ve been searching for a skin care routine I love for 10 years and I think I’ve finally found a staple. While I’m not in love with the smell of this product, it dissipates quickly and the results are worth it. My pores look much smaller and some milia around my eyes is almost gone. I’ve been using this at night and Tidal in the mornings.",2
This face mask is really great for catching up on “me time“. I find the scent is wonderful. This mask works well if you have dry skin but don’t want to use something thick like a face cream. This would be a great gift for anyone who likes rose scents.,2
I was using the Bobbi Brown Hydrating Face Cream and loved it. The Sephora employee recommended this to me since it has extra vitamins. I couldn’t get past the smell. It smells floral-y and I don’t want my skincare products/ makeup to have a scent. Scents don’t do anything to help improve my skin. It works just the same as the hydrating face cream.,1
"I recently received a complimentary from Fresh. This such an amazing cream. I really love the texture of this cream, it is super nice sinking into the skin. This product works wonderfully, just perfect for my dry skin, especially during this winter time which is my skin feels so dry and flaky. I would say that this is my life savior, i highly recommend this product to everyone.",2
This sunscreen is amazing! I love the lightweight formula and typically gear towards Korean beauty sunscreens because of how light they are. But this one is so good. There’s no weird overcast and it applies evenly on my skin. My skin feels so soft. The packaging is beautiful too.,2
This smells great and really melts my makeup away! Double cleansing is an important step in my routine to get rid of my makeup and sunscreen. I recommend this and in general double cleansing to those who wear makeup or wear sunscreen!,2
"Product was recommended by a consultant for my combination skin. I love the fresh cucumber smell, but it leaves my skin dry and tight. It does remove my make-up, which is a plus. I’m also noticing my moisturizer sits on my skin since I started to use the face wash. With my old face wash, my moisturizer would get obsorbed quickly and work its magic.",1
Reduces redness amazingly well,2
"Love the smell, the taste and my lips are soft!!!!!!",2
"I’ve used a ton of lip treatments and this product is the best! Let’s just say they used to call me chapstick girl back in my prime. That sounds like an oxymoron, but really- I was a Bonne Bell poster child and 5th grade was really my peak. Anyways, this lip mask is amazing and completely worth it. I’ve used the berry flavor every night for a couple months now and the containern still looks nearly full. Definitely worth the price.",2
Nice packaging. Felt nice on my skin. Not sure it really has done anything for me though. I need to keep using it to see if there is any change. Didn’t break me out and I have sensitive skin.,1
"Love this. Put it on your eyelids or cheeks for some glow, on or on chapped lips, dry hands, cuticles, elbows. Can’t do without",2
"If you are consistent with it and use this product every single night, then you will notice the differences. My skin became brighter as well as more clear (acne-wise), and I feel like it helped with my oil a little bit as well. Overall, I’m super happy, and I went ahead and purchased a 2nd bottle when I ran out. :)",2
"My favorite cleanser! Not overly stripping, extremely refreshing and leaves my skin feeling so clean. For a while I was only able to get sample/travel sizes and was so thrilled to see the pump size available. Only reason for 4 stars is the price tag.",1
"I received this free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. Upon opening the box, I was impressed by the sleek luxurious box Estee is known for. I felt super fancy. I used this eye cream for only two weeks and my very dark circle have been visibly reduced and my eye area is hydrated. I did not see much difference in my minimal lines but my main concerns are dark circles and hydration. I have used so many eye gels and creams with no results so I did not have high hopes but this is a holy grail for me. I don’t even have to use concealer everyday anymore!! The texture is a silky gel, a little goes a long way, it spreads easily and absorbs pretty quick. The high price tag is literally the only negative I can think of. I would highly highly recommend this product!",2
"The is the Goldilocks of facial moisturizer - not too greasy, perfect amount of nourishing properties that leaves my skin hydrated all day. I love that it’s core ingredient is Ashwagandha - such a natural",2
The coconut water wipes are refreshing and invigorating. Nice clean feeling without feeling over-dried.,2
I received this complimentary from Influsenter for testing purposes and I’m so glad I did. I was breaking out so badly from the season change in New England and this product helped heal my dry skin in less than a week. I usually have oily skin but the extra dry weather took a toll on my skin which caused a ton of breakouts. The formula is moisturizing but not too heavy which I like. The scent isn’t over powering and my face looks bouncy and glowing after. Definitely worth purchasing.,2
I got this in the birthday gift from Sephora and I love it!!! Even more than the serum that came with it. The texture is super unite and feels great on the skin. It is light enough that it doesn’t grease up my t-zone but it’s so moisturizing.,2
I love the fresh watermelon scent but the formula doesnt for my sensitive skin. It causes me to have a lot of redness.  This product may work well for someone with normal skin that just wants a very light moisturizer.,1
"I’m using this around 1,5 year, now noticed wrinkles on my forehead and neck. So, this product is great for radiance and hydrating, but just for this. It doesn’t fix wrinkles. I’m 35, combination skin. Just stop smoking.",1
This product was gifted to me by Dermalogica Sampling. This was something new to me and I was skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised with how soft my skin was after! I like the new concept of this exfoliant. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate.,2
"I am currently using my 4th bottle. It gets absorbed so quickly, and it’s really moisturizing at the same time without any pearly pinkish texture or greasy feeling. Also it does not irritate my eyes. I can’t say that it works for the dark circles but does help the puffiness subsides. The only complain that I have is the bottle...I wish it has a pump so I don’t have to put my fingers inside of it.",1
"Wow, I can’t say enough good things about this balm!! Smell: amazing. That taste when you accidentally lick your lips: yummy enough to make you want to eat the whole tube. Hydration quality for lips that live and breathe in the wicked East Coast chill: impeccable. Sorry, Carmex, you just weren’t cutting it for me anymore. I’ve now gone and bought these in every scent.",2
"Lovely signature Tatcha scent and creamy smooth application. My skin’s been really dry recently, so I’ve been cycling through different moisturizers every two weeks, and this is one of the worst I’ve tried. It doesn’t absorb and leaves my skin feeling greasy and heavy instead of nourished. There are so so so many better skin creams out there.",0
I am in love!! I have been purchasing hyaluronic acid for years now. but off amazon oz naturals for 30 dollars same size bottle and it was good but not compared too this... and price point is absolutely amazing!!!   so impressed I am a forever customer as long as it stays here in canada!! great feel no oily skin and i have bad oil in my skin when I get a bad product.,2
I mean there isn’t enough good things I can say about this mask. If you have redness you can literally see this mask taking it away as it’s on. It makes your skin flawless and it’s amazing for acne prone skin. I’ll seriously cry if this is ever discontinued.,2
"This stuff is fantastic! Goes on smooth & lasts a long time. Smells yummy & doesn’t taste funky. Makes my lips smooth, pink & plump. I must have more!",2
This cleanser is very worth the hype! I have combo skin and gel cleansers tend to leave me dry and tight but not this one. Leaves my skin super soft. It seems to be evening out my post acne marks too.,2
"The longer I use this the more I love it. I am now on my 4th or 5th bottle. I exfoliate and wash my face in the morning then apply a few drops directly on my face and spread. I use a tinted moisturizer on top, and I’m good all day long. I have combination skin that tends to get dry in the winter, so this works for me. It does not make me break out. I foudn a secret to be regular face cleansing - it gets rid of excess oil.This is a staple in my beauty routine, I won’t live without it! It’s all natural, moisturizing, and my skin loves it. It’s pricey, so I hope they won’t keep raising the price.",2
"I wanted to like this product because it came highly recommended, but I quickly found that it was similar in consistency to petroleum jelly (like Vaseline) and didn’t really do anything remarkable for my face. I felt like to properly wash it off my face after applying, it required me to tug at my skin, and nearly always left my pores feeling clogged and dry afterwards. Usually I have the opposite problem with products, as I feel like they strip the oil from my face and make my skin too tight and dry. After a wash, my face would feel far more textured by the end of the day. I really disliked this. To make matters worse, when I finished the bottle, the product had started to mold inside the bottle and around the cap. I won’t be purchasing from Inkey list again after this one.",0
This product is absolutely wonderful! I’ve tried so many moisturizers and this is the only one that seems to work for my super dry and odd patchy oily parts of my skin. It is a but in the heavier side but it absorbs quickly and it’s definitely worth the price!,2
"I bought this product 2 weeks ago and saw a significant difference in my skin. My skin was severely dry (my cheeks were red from being chapped and dry). I was in dire need of a boost of hydration. I am a drunk elephant junkie...but I was told to give this a try. I’m SO happy I did! I use this morning and night. A MUST is your skin HAS to be a little damp for it to work. If not, it feels like it doesn’t absorb at all. I use this product with the tea tree toner from lush. I fully dry my face, spray the toner and pat 2 pumps all over my face. I’ve had zero problems with this method, however I fully understand everyone is different and this might not work for them. I noticed my skin was so much more hydrated after a few days! The redness on my cheeks went away as well (which I usually have slight redness, but that’s gone too). I also paired this at night with Sephora’s firming night cream (this did such wonders for my extremely dry skin) During the day I paired this with the toner from lush, this product and followed up with an eye cream & sephoras firming day cream.",2
"Posting this so people can relate if the same situation happens to them too, and looks like it does. I tried 2 deluxe samples of this and liked them. Then I purchased the moisturizing bomb because it was in a set. I had terrible white little pimples across my whole face. I didn’t think it was this product, but returned it anyway. I then tried a little sample of this aqua bomb and was ok so I went to purchase this aqua bomb in a set. Used for 3 days and broke out again really badly. I am not sure how bigger size is different from deluxe sizes, and I can’t be 100% this product is at fault, but my main retinol, vitamin c, acids, and all other more advanced skin care are the same. Maybe it didn’t work with one of them. Too bad because I initially really liked the product.",0
This product started working the very first night I used it. My lips have never felt so soft and smooth.,2
this product is amazing I love it especially if you’ve been out in the sun. I use it several times a day on days that I’m not wearing make up. It feels great on the skin.,2
"I couldn’t decide between this and “Hope in a Jar“ and I decided to go the cheaper route, and I’m so glad! I took home a sample of the Philosophy moisturizer and couldn’t stand how it felt on my face. This FAB Ultra Repair Cream is so much more light weight but still moisturizes. It barely has a scent and a little goes a long way. I’ll definitely continue to buy!",2
"I am not joking put this in your cart or go down to any Sephora store and get this now! It is one of the best products I’ve ever used. I used to get the occasional acne spot here and there, and have combo/oily skin. Now my skin is clear and radiant. After three months of using it, people have said my face is glowing (which never happened). It reduces my old scars, and smooths over other blemishes by the morning. I use this every night. A few drops goes a long way and have barely made a dent in the serum. I swear this stuff is magic, and I don’t mean this lightly. I am suspicious of miracle products, but I can honestly say that this really is. I love that it’s natural, and the smell is amazing. This is part of the small products I endorse seriously!",2
I love this moisturizer it’s super light weight. And it smells so refreshing I can’t wait to add it to my am/pm skin care routine.,2
"Shame on PTR for claiming this lifts and sweeps away anything. I’ve used PTR products for 10+ years with great success and I’m an exfoliation junkie. But this product does nothing but curdle up during application. I’m giving it 2 stars for the moisturizing benefits. Otherwise, don’t bother.",0
Dr Dennis Gross help me in my face am received this sample in pinchme,2
"I am huge on putting spf on my face, neck and chest. This particular sunscreen, you have to shake because it settles. So I was nervous about that, BUT after I applied it to my face I was happy! It’s light weight, I used it under makeup and it didn’t clog my pores.",2
"I have been wanting to try the vegan milk skincare line from Milk Makeup, and it did not disappoint!! This moisturizer was plump, creamy, and very hydrating! I have pretty dry, dull, and uneven skin texture; this vegan milk moisturizer helped me fix all of it! I am very thankful to have found a moisturizer that works for my skin, and not to mention had clean ingredients! My dry skin is not longer a huge barrier for me. This is a new holy grail product in my skincare routine! I received this moisturizer complimentary from influenster for testing purposes. #Complimentary #Influenster #VeganMilkMoisturizer",2
"Wow. Where do I begin with this amazing face wash, first time using it and I fell in love. Right after washing my face it left my skin super soft & glowy. Love the beads because they give you a perfect gentle scrub to remove all dirt but most importantly, it removed all my makeup without a problem. Im so in love with the smell & I will definitely recommend. Even though I received this from Influenster for free, once this bottle is gone, I will DEFINITELY go out and restock.",2
"I’ve been using this cleanser for years! I have combo/oily skin which is very prone to breakouts. This used to be the BEST cleanser.. It removed all oiliness, prevented breakouts, and washed away old makeup. However, something has been irritating as of lately. After washing my face with this, my foreheads gets very itchy and irritated. I also would have dried out skin around my T-zone. After dealing with it for awhile, I’m now on the lookout for a new cleanser.",0
"I love this product which is a great moisturizer, particularly for the body. However, I’ve only given it three stars because the packaging is terrible. Other than the 2 ounce size of this product, in which it is the most expensive, of course, all other sizes come in a plastic jar with a screw top lid. This exposes all of the product each time to the air and your fingers or the object used to get the moisturizer out so it can be used. I have always disliked using my fingers to retrieve a product from the packaging. I don’t like the way it contaminates it, the way it feels under my fingernails nor that I have to clean up my hands & the jar after each use no matter how careful I am. Please do better First Aide Beauty.",1
"I recently purchased the Sephora Waterproof makeup remover. I heard a YouTuber that I love say it was the best. So I didn’t even do any research, just bought it! I was so disappointed! Along with that order I got a sample of the cleansing balm. I AM SO IMPRESSED!!! I usually have mascara left under my eyes but not after I used this!!!! It doesn’t leave a residue or anything! So as soon as I am able to go to Sephora to return the other, I will be purchasing this!!!",2
I received this product complimentary from Fresh. I was so excited to find a product that would help my dry skin. This stuff is the bomb! It leaves my face feeling so very hydrated. I would love to try more products from this brand!,2
"Pros: Great for acne, firm and plump texture within hours/ days, in the summer I was able to skip moisturiser, simple ingredient list.Cons: Price. Price. Price.I will say this product works for what it is.  However, the price is probably one of the biggest scams in the industry.  It used to be one of the few essences on the market, but times have changed and the cost is just ridiculous.  Plus I have a good feeling a lot of the heavy lifting is done by everything but the “Pitera.“  I would probably purchase again while travelling  as it is sometimes available for almost less than half the retail price, then throw in the exchange rate and you’ve got yourself a deal.",1
I love the eye cream version of this so I thoughtI needed to try this. It smells very refreshing and feels nice going on but it’s much too light for me. My skin is sometimes super dry in the winter but right now since it’s gotten warmer it’s not. Probably just considered normal. If you’re looking for something very light this might be worth a try but for me it just didn’t do anything for my skin.,1
Love this product! It’s my number one go to product for dry lips. I’m never disappointed of how this preforms & the smell of it is just an added bonus!,2
"Amazing! i love the minty taste. its not super goey or sticky, which is good when your outside on a hot and humid day. when you first put it on, you feel your lips tingle. i love this lipbalm. i will def. buy when i run out",2
"This sugar lip treatment gifted to me by Fresh is probably one of my new favorites. The packaging is very pretty and sleek, and I love how it is a twist top. Upon looking at the product, it looks like a lipstick. However it is more of a buildable color and looks very natural on the lips. It makes my lips feel soft, but I would prefer it to feel a bit more hydrating. I do like how the product contains several vitamins and fruit oils.",2
"I started using this product about a year ago after all the youtube recommendations. You apply it on your dry face, which I thought was a quirky twist.Pros:-It definitely does what it says: removes all makeup with one wash. This product glides over my makeup like butter, and easily removes everything without irritation or excessive scrubbing-Like all Clinique products, it’s fragrance and irritant free-It lasts quite a while. I’m pretty generous with the amount I use each night and the jar lasts me around 4-5 months.Cons:-The milky cleanser leaves a slight waxy residue on my skin that is difficult to completely remove unless I blast my face with water-It’s definitely a one hit wonder. It’s awesome at removing all makeup, but has no other skin or acne benefits-The past two jars I’ve had, towards the end of the jars’ life, begin to emit a mildew smell and the thick waxy product disintegrates, leaving curds of wax swimming in an oil residue at the bottom of the jar. I suppose this is from bacteria buildup (which freaks me out because I’m generally a clean freak germaphobe) with the multiple use. The product volume lasts longer than it’s general use expiration date (not printed expiration date, which is 2 years).Overall, it’s a great makeup remover that should be followed up with your favorite face cleanser.",1
"This product is thick like a lotion, but still spreads evenly and you don’t need a lot of product. At first it does leave a greasy feeling to the skin, but as someone that is dry I absolutely love that! I know my face is being moisturized. I did receive this product complimentary for sampling purposes through influenster!",1
"I love the texture and how it makes my skin so supple and hydrated! Definitely for my dry pals out there. It a thick whipped gel texture and absorbs immediately into the skin. I also enjoy the scent a lot.  After showering I like to apply this on my face and it very refreshing. Knocked off one star because it is quite pricey in my books :( Will most likely purchase again if I have the funds. Will check out the aqua bomb next, seems great for summer!",1
"I really love this nourishing, fragrance-free cream from my favorite brand. It is such an amazing cream for the dry sensitive skin. It has restored my skin barrier and locked the hydration into the skin. The texture feels rich but it absorbs into the skin and gives my skin a healthy glow. I am very happy with the results so far and will continue to use it to get the long-term benefits.I strongly recommend this cream for all skin types, especially for dry skin types.",2
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY! This is literally a DREAM mask. The scent is amazing. The texture is perfect and the results are undeniable.,2
I bought the trial size and I absolutely loved it. Very gentle on the skin and cleans very well! It also helped reduce my redness and dryness.,1
"I bought the Flash Fix initially because I was so curious about the products over all.  After my first 2 days of using Good Genes, I went on and bought the full size bottle.  This product has completely changed my skin.  For years I have had very small clogged pores that nothing would get ride of.  I have facials quite frequently, wash my face religiously, exfoliate, use masks.. I had tried it all.  In just 3 days these issues dissipated.  It has been about a month now and the results are still the same- I use it once in the evening after I wash my face and pat dry, there’s a slight burning sensation when the chemicals are doing their work and then the next morning my skin is bright, hydrated, and blemish free.  I will note that it has not dried my skin out either.",2
"Not worth the price. I cleaned one half of my face with this and the other half used my usual makeup remover wipes, then with a cotton puff and some micellar water went over each side. The half that was “cleaned” with the Farmacy product had a little more makeup left behind and although it’s very oily, it dried out my skin. Would recommend trying a sample before purchasing.",0
"I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. The are so many great things about this product. For starters the packaging is absolutely gorgeous and the balm comes with a little scoop for you to take out the product. I used this product to remove my makeup and it did a pretty good job. I usually use micellar water but this balm did a way better job than micellar water. The reason why I took 1 star off is because while rising it does take a while to get rid of the product, when they say to rinse thoroughly they mean it. At the end my face ended up looking and feeling great. I was impressed by the fact it didn’t dry my skin at all.",1
Y’all… I’ve been using this as hand cream and honestly it’s so good! My hands in this weather is cracked and irritated. This does not only have the hyaluronic acid to hydrate and draw moisture but it repairs without feeling sticky or greasy. I don’t think I ever need to spend $30+ for hand cream ever again. Buy this!,2
"My husband got the minty flavor and we fell in love. Just purchase the Black Tea and Blackberry today and it is hands down the best lip balm ever. Light scent and taste, nothing too crazy and doesn’t have any strange artificial aftertaste. Four thumbs up... or five stars. :)",2
Got this product free for review purpose. Try this exfoliator for 1 week and I like it. It leaves a fresh sensation on my face. Skin feels soft and clean. I like it that you could use it daily basis. I really recommend it.,2
"If you’re looking for a gentle daily exfoliator, this could be it! It has a gentle, rice and oatmeal scent and the product itself turns into a nice paste with water. Its definitely gentle enough for everyday use, and is not super harsh",1
I received this a #complimentary #phatglow facial mask through #influenster. I’ve used it a few times for a week now and i loved it! i have a sensitive skin and so far it works great! you just apply an even layer to clean dry face and massage it until it turns from pink to white which is really cool. rinse off or use a damp towel. My skin felt light and feels really tight after using it. i highly recommend this product!,1
"I received this product for free from Influenster. I have pretty dry skin and this worked great for me. It’s lightweight, yet still moisturizing. The scent is also amazing and helps me wake up feeling refreshed! Wil definitely purchase when I finish this jar. Love it!",2
I have very dry skin and using this stuff makes my skin so shiny and I love it.,2
"I received a gift card to select a product of my choice to review.I really love this moisturizer! I work in skincare and have sensitive skin, so I’m super picky about my products that I like to use. It’s super light weight and moisturizing and has been a game-changer during these winter months.",2
"I love Fresh products, so I’m very disappointed by this cleanser. First, the smell is horrid. It smells like cleaning fluid. I simply do not understand how some reviewers can say it smells good. But second, it’s not much of an exfoliant. The sugar crystals dissolve too quickly and then you’re left with a thick film that does not easily wash off. As I said, I love the brand, but this one is a miss and I will be returning it.",0
Love this.   Micro beads are very small and gentle.  Love the smell.  Wish there was a pump though..,2
"This feels like fresh water on your skin cooling , refreshing. Not sticky at all.",2
"I purchased this after having a lot of redness from allergy season and I have very sensitive skin. I do not like a lot of makeup as a result, of such skin sensitivity. I actually just use a little bit of this to even out my skin tone and provide more sunscreen protection. I do not wear a foundation - just this stuff and a light concealer. It really helps me have a natural look rather than perhaps big pink allergy eyes. Now- how to use it - you get a small dot size amount and let it warm up on your fingertips. Just pat on. A little goes a long way.",2
Moisturizing but not greasy. Soaks in well and makes for a good makeup primer. My skin is sensitive and this is soothing.,2
"I’m a fan! It can be a bit hard with applying, but I do love how it makes my skin look so soft and dewy. I loved how well it looks once it fully sets in. It does have a consistency of water which usually isn’t my thing, but it actually worked wonders. I received the product free for testing purposes from Influenster and Tatcha, and I didn’t expect it to work as amazingly as it did. It gave me a bit of skin confidence dare I say!",2
I like that it’s refreshing and I can use it to blot off any extra makeup,1
I loved the way this product felt while applying it. It was very smooth and made my face feel clean and fresh! I loved how it made my face feel after application. My face felt smooth and soft for over 12 hours after applying! I thought it was awesome to receive a product with ingredients like Greek yoghurt in it!,1
"My skin tends to be on the dry side and I had attempted use both in warm and colder weather and I didn’t react very well as it irritated my skin, made it red, patchy and extremely itchy. It does absorb quickly hence the two stars.",0
"I love this entire line and the cream is no exception. I use the serum, gel cream or this cream, and the calming mist so it’s hard to pinpoint what gives the best results but you really can’t go wrong. I don’t notice a huge difference between this cream and the gel formula but they both do a great job calming and hydrating my skin. If anything I wish this were even more hydrating to set it apart from the gel more but that only because I’m super dry! *I received this product complimentary for testing purposes",2
"I really wanted to like this product because I enjoy Fresh so much. I read so many great reviews I thought I would give it a shot. I was looking for an exfoliant as I was having some congested and clogged pores. This one exfoliates but very gently. The sugar granules do melt quite easy with the addition to water and makes it difficult to actually exfoliate. If you’re not big on scents I also would avoid this product. It doesn’t bother me, but I know some are sensitive. If you’re looking for a gentle or light exfoliant then this would be a nice product to try.",0
What can I say about this other than this is essential to my night time routine. I use this every night to take off my makeup. It is so gentle and so effective. It gets off my most stubborn eyeliner (I’m looking at you Lancôme Drama LiquiPencil) and waterproof mascara. My skin always feels so clean after I use it. It is perfect for using before a cleanser because it really takes of everything. I normally follow with the Clinique face wash for oily skin.,2
"Unlike some of the overnight creams I’ve tried, this makes my skin feel soft not sticky.  When I wake up my skin feels hydrates and smooth and ready for the next day.",2
It dries my lips out so bad. I don’t have an issue with dry or cracked lips but this only caused me to have exactly that ☹️,0
"Well, this is my first review and I felt the need to write one because this lip balm is a waste of money. I don’t think its great, its okay and I’ve been a lip balm addict for a very long time and have tried $1 to $40 lip balms. Stick with your current fav and don’t bother wasting your time on this one.",0
Excellent-I use this on severely chapped lips as well as on my kids’ sensitive dry cheeks and it works wonders. I am never without this salve!,2
"Very effective chemical peel! I use this peel every 2 or 3 nights before bed and on my very oily acne prone and sensitive skin it gives me healthy soft clear skin but no flaking, redness, dryness or any other bad skin issues like other peels have given me. I can see my black heads slowly shrinking away and my skin getting a nice radiance I didn’t have before! This definitely has improved my skin and I recommend it to everyone.",2
"This product is ultra hydrating for my skin in the arid environment I live in.  While I don’t think it makes wrinkles and fine lines go away, I think it moisturizes do well that it prevents them from getting worse.  It is thick, a little sticky, and looks oily at first, but after a few minutes it soaks in.  Works pretty well under my concealer too.",2
"I’ve only used a few times, so I can’t give a super in depth review, BUT I must say in the couple days I’ve been using it, I can already see a difference. My skin looks bright, and even just feels better. I do have sensitive, combination skin, and it does tingle a little, but I’m sure this will change after more uses. I haven’t noticed that my skin feels drier on the areas that are typically dry, in fact it feels quiet even these days. Will revisit this after I finish my sample size!",1
"Is it cooling? No it’s not, but it’s a really nice moisturizer.",2
"I was given this product for free to test out.  I’ve used this for one month and have seen an impact on how shiny my skin would look at the end of the day.  I would usually need blotting paper, but with this system it was able to go more low maintenance to control my oiliness. I have very oily skin so this is perfect for me.  The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is that I went to Las Vegas for one week and my skin need a lot more hydration.  So if your going to dryer climates keep this in mind.  However, if you have oily skin this is your holy grail item that will control your shine all day long.",1
"a very hydrating face wash, I always try to get this in the little Christmas duo set that comes out because I love it so much! My face is so clean and plump after every use I think this has made it to my top 3 favorite face washes ever!!",2
I received Dermalogica’s Daily Microfoliant for free. This product is very gentle and did not irritate my skin at all. It left my skin feeling very soft and smooth. Would definitely recommend this product.,2
It’s a great cream I love how it’s made from Greek yogurt would recommend just that it’s kind of pricey.,1
I use it day and night! My face always is hydrated and feeling soft now!,2
Glow Recipe’s new plum plump hyaluronic cream feels soft and creamy on application. My skin feels more hydrated and firm. This isn’t just in application but throughout my entire work day. My skin also overall glows more than my other products. My only issue with the product is that it took a while for the cream to absorb but it eventually does. It could be due to the serum ive use prior to application so I’m going to try changing up the order for this week.,2
"Very light on the skin, easy to feel and use. Love the product design and how it gives off a simplistic look and looks great on the counter as well!! Fan of the smell as well. Not too aggressive but nice.",1
"I use the Protini Polypeptide Moisturizer daily and it has dramatically improved my skin. My skin’s elasticity has improved, and all of my fine lines have disappeared! I had first been given a sample from my Allure box, that’s when I became hooked. I LOVE this product!",2
This product is amazing!! I have been struggling with serious hormonal breakouts after having my second child. I just turned 30 and never struggled with problematic skin until 6 months ago. Within 2 weeks of use this product has significantly lightened my pigmentation from the acne and is clearing my skin while brightening my overall complexion. Do not doubt purchasing!! You will have no regrets!!,2
"The Dermalogica daily microfoliant exfoliator is gentle but effective. The powder is fine and smooth, there is no scent. The exfoliator does not feel gritty or irritating like some scrubs, I have some sensitive areas around my nose that has broken capillaries and I love how gentle it feels. It has more texture than the Amore Pacific, I find the Dermalogica easier to use. It is helping to clear up the breakouts I have in my t-zone and my pores appear more refined, skin still feels comfortable no over drying that you may see with some exfoliating cleansers. Makeup applies much more smoothly. I would recommend even to the most sensitive.",1
I suffer from eczema and sensitive skin on my cheeks and I try to steer away from using steroid creams and this has saved my skin! I use it at night as a night cream or sometimes just as my eye cream and around my cheeks and I wake up with baby soft skin. I also sometimes use it as a primer and have found it makes my makeup application much better. I’ve already repurchased twice and will continue to do so.,2
"I had to use a few pumps to get it to work well and keep my makeup on/in place. I think if you use enough it’s great, but for the price point I’m not sure I would repurchase.",1
"I love how it makes my skin feel moisturized. It’s the best for under makeup (concealer), I searched my whole life for an eye cream to let me apply my concealer smoothly and evenly.",2
"* I received this product for free to test from Influenster *This is one of the best moisturizers that I have tried from Origns so far. I have very oily skin, so I am prone to frequent breakouts as well as clogged pores and white heads. This moisturizer works wonders for my skin! Keeps my oily skin balanced and moisturized, as well as clears my pores and has lowered the amount of breakouts that occur on my face. I absolutely love this moisturizer and would recommend to friends and family!",2
This is a great night time moisturizer that sinks in well but does leave me oily! My skin feels so soft after using it and no break outs!,1
"I absolutely love this lip balm. It is incredibly hydrating, and it smells deliciously of delicate vanilla. It doesn’t have any sweet taste. It doesn’t feel sticky at all. The original shade is just shiny - no color. If you want a really amazing lip balm I promise you it will not disappoint!",2
"way too sticky, and it doesn’t eventually absorb. I wore it on my face for two entire days and my hair kept sticking to my face allllll day long, until I washed it off. It’s uncomfortable having a film on my face all day- I will be returning it.",0
"Very impressed with the results.  Its thick so it doesn’t take a lot & the results are amazing.  Clean fresh skin & as it warms up & blemishes usually get worse, I haven’t seen any!!",2
"This is such an awesome moisturizer! I was a bit apprehensive to try it because of its consistency and the fact that I have combo/oily skin, but I was pleasantly surprised! It really doesn’t make me any more oily than I usually am which I’m totally fine with, it absorbs quickly, it doesn’t make me break out, and it really helps with dry spots from hormonal acne. Love using it on my body/hands/feet as well. Winter is fast approaching, so I know this is going to feel even better on my Midwestern winter skin! Definitely buying a giant container of this.",2
"Skin instantly feels clean, soft and smooth without being shiny ir drying. Perfect for oily/sensitive skin.",2
This product is incredible its like a drink of water for your skin,2
"Clinique’s cleansing balm is reliable - which is a great thing. Takes off every stitch of makeup and sunscreen; washes off clean with no residue; no weird smell; does not burn my eyes; and does not make my dry, reactive skin red or sensitive. I always have an extra balm on hand and have bought a number of these. A great basic to stock up on.",2
"It does what it says it does - moisturizer. However, it makes my face feel...tacky? It feels sticky and slightly heavy. I don’t know, it’s not my favorite moisturizer.",1
"After complete cleansing, we refresh the face with essence.  The skin has become fresh and well-groomed.  all thanks to Pitere in its composition, it is a unique component obtained from brewer’s yeast, rich in minerals, amino acids and vitamins.  The packaging is very convenient to take with you and to refresh your face during the day.  dear friends, I recommend!",2
"This product is amazing ! I tried the sample, and had to buy it. After one night, I awoke to amazing, glowing dewy skin. It may feel thick at night, but you awake to healthy, radiant skin. I use this at night and Origins Mangosteen moisturizer during the day.",2
The ordinary love you foverer the best love love love love,2
"This may be due to my already oily skin but this mist creates too much shine for me. I don’t really recommend this mist if you have oily skin since it creates this sort of film on top of your skin that could make you look like grease. However, if you have dry skin, I think this mist can give your skin a nice sheen and make you look dewy.",1
5 STARS! this product really wakes you up the cooling beads makes you feel so refreshed. I will definitely be buying tis product after I run out I was lucky to receive this product via influenster to test try!,2
"This cleanser is very good; it has only a very slight Scent and has a nice, silky lather which rinses clean leaving my skin moisturized. For something that appears to be yet another boring gel cleanser, it was surprisingly luxe.",2
"La première fois que j’ai utilisé la crème, je l’ai trouvé la texture agréable et ma peau était bien hydratée. cependant j’ai eu une une poussée d’acné qui a duré environ 1 semaine. J’ai une peau combinée (huileuse et sèche) et je l’utilisais davantage le soir, puisqu’elle était beaucoup trop riche pour ma peau pour le jour. Je conseillerais davantage cette crème pour les gens ayant la peau sèche.",1
"Have been using for over 3 weeks now. I feel the plumping effect that the videos talk about. It is nice to use this when your skin is still wet, so it can lock on to that moisture. I usually spray a toner and then start applying. The pump is nice, gives you a good amount. Its about the size of an apple.",2
This is the ultimate enhancer. My skin is dry combo and has been very dry since the winter season. This product has enhanced my other skincare products and I can tell a difference when I don’t use it. This makes my other Tatcha products and moisturizers better and I don’t think I can live without it.,2
"I’ve used cleansing oils by DHC, Shiseido Origins (Origins Clean Energy Cleansing Oil is my HG) so I thought I would give this one a try in the mini size... So glad I didn’t buy a full size--it’s not a true cleansing OIL. The main ingredient in this is POLYSORBATE 80 (a binder & emulsifier), next is Sunflower Seed Oil, Safflower Seed Oil, *Argan Oil, FRAGRANCE, Grape Seed Oil & Olive Oil. Notice the superstar ingredient is right before the fragrance? That means there’s very little of it in this cleansing oil--only a tiny amount of fragrance is needed to scent products. Yes, it works as a cleanser, but I expected so much more from Miss Maran & her natural products! $32 for 6 ounces? That’s $5.33 an ounce, versus Origins $3.58 an ounce, which has 10+ different oils in it. I’m sticking with Origins!",0
"I received this product complimentary from Sunday Riley. This is going to be my second bottle of Lactic Acid. I previously bought about a year ago and was really satisfied with the results it left my skin with. I had a very even tone and it took almost all the blemishes away. The only reason I didn’t purchase it again is because I always like to try out what’s new out there, I could definitely vouch for this one. You will not regret it, worth every penny!",2
I have combination skin so I look for a moisturizer that does not grease my skin. This was a perfect fix. It is cooling and makes my skin glow. Also smells very sweet and fresh!I would recommend for comb skin,2
"This gets all my base makeup off so well! I do struggle with getting off my mascara sometimes, but I think that I more me not wanting to rub my eyes too hard! It does not irritate my skin at all or burn if it gets in my eyes. I will repurchase!",2
Love this really helps with dark spots. Reasonable price,1
"This stuff is great! The formula is light without making my skin feel heavy, or leaving clogged pores. I would use this right after the shower to best results. I received this item for free for testing purposes.",2
I had purchased this a few months ago and recently received another one for free from Influenster. I love this mask! I use it about once a week to clear out my pores and detox my skin!,1
"This is a great product that I used to love years ago and was just recently reintroduced into my life with a one-week sample. The feel on the skin is luxurious and the smell makes me feel like I’m finishing a spa treatment. As far as results, my dry skin feels nice and plump and my dullness has improved! Definitely recommend trying out for the dry folks.",1
"This Microfoliant was gifted by Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. Its an interesting texture, its like little flakes that you get wet and then rub on your face. I liked the way it made by skin feel. It definitely made it feel softer. It’s super gentle and I can see myself using it often. I think leaving it in the shower isn’t a good idea because the flakes melt when they get wet.",2
"Good serum. Only got a sample so I can’t speak to it’s long term effects, but seems great.",1
I loveeee this serum. As soon as I switched to the inkey list serum I noticed a huge difference. Will forever repurchase.,2
"I was hesitant to use this cleanser because I have a skin routine from which I do not normally deviate, but I was happy to have tried it and am actually continuing to use it.  I do not wear makeup, so I cannot attest to how well it removes that.  However, I love the way it makes my skin feel soft and smooth after my shower.  I am used to using hydrocolloidal oatmeal lotion on my face due to severe dryness in the winter, so the feeling of it does not bother me.  However, it is definitely a feel to get used to because it almost feels like you haven’t fully washed the product off when you actually have.  Definitely works well for my sensitive dry skin!",2
"If I can only splurge on one product, it would be this one. It really does everything it claims.",2
"I love that this serum comes as a mix-it-yourself serum making it as fresh as it can possibly get! This serum includes a powder, liquid and a dispenser bottle and has easy to follow directions to mix it up. It does have a unique scent (almost a bit fruity) but it isn’t too strong. I find it best to let the serum sink into my skin for about 5-10 minutes before following up with a moisturizer & sunscreen because it is a bit tacky until it fully absorbs. Since switching to this serum I’ve noticed some of my dark spots lightening up a little. I’ll definitely continue to use this serum! *Gifted by Drunk Elephant",1
"I started using this 3 days ago in my PM routine, after I apply Niacinamide, and I have noticed a difference when I wake up - my forehead lines are significantly decreased and my face looks brighter. It does a good job at hydrating and plumping.",2
"I remember the first time I tried this was in Sephora and I was s h o o k. I had read really great reviews about Sunday Riley’s UFO, claiming to be a good acne spot treatment. All they had in the store was LUNA, so I dabbed a bit on a giant pimple without reading the labor. Just a few hours later, I looked and the zit was at least halfway gone! So of course I came back and bought it. Even though it is supposed to “reduce wrinkles,“ I purchased it for acne and redness. Now, I put it on every night before bed (mostly just on trouble spots) and it has significantly reduced redness and size of pimples. I don’t always break out, but it has made my period breakouts so much better. As for reducing pores, I didn’t really notice a difference. It also smells AMAZING (wayyyyy better than UFO)!",1
"I’m not sure what all the hype is about. I received this as a freebie (well i redeemed 100 of my points) and tried it that very first night.. I do really like the smell and the exfoliates feel good on my skin but that’s it. I guess my skin felt clean, idk! The next day I had a tiny pimple on my jaw (but it may be due to onset of menses), idk if it it was this product or ??? I’ll try it again in a few weeks but for now, it’s just BLAH for me.",0
"I will never change cleansers. Best one I have ever tried. So gentle, I used it while on a prescription retinoid and it kept my skin in great condition.",2
so this product does indeed sting. it’s not nearly as bad as youtubers make it seem. it’s kind of like if you had a bug bite and you couldn’t scratch it. and I’m someone with horribly sensitive skin.but as far as how it makes my skin feel and look when it comes off i will say its pretty great. I use it once or twice a week and it helps to calm new and emerging acne and just perk up my skin. I fully suggest it. its helped to even out the texture and add some youthfulness to it.,1
I’ve tried numerous products to clear up my acne and this one seems to work the best. It can only be used at night cause it goes on pink and dries that way -- but definitely worth it for the results.,2
I really like this moisturizer. My skin starts to get dry this time of year and this really moisturizes it. It goes on nicely and soaks right in. My skin looks brighter and definitely feels smoother.,2
This moisturizer works great with my oily skin. It keeps my face light and refreshed. The smell is absolutely amazing. It provides enough hydration without making your face feel greasy or look shiny. Definitely recommend this!,2
I was actually really impressed with this. I was worried about charcoal aspect of it especially with the warning that it might cause dryness and/or itchiness especially when combined with other acne related products BUT I haven’t had any negative reactions and my skin is VERY finicky. I’ve definitely had severe reactions to other products in the past and this did NOT do that. I found in combination with my spot treating benzo that my skin has visibly less breakouts. It’s also creamy without being overalls oily feeling. I have oily skin and I can’t use heavy creams. I generally prefer gels but this I really like. My only complaint so far is that it doesn’t smell the best. I’ve only been using it for about a week but I would definitely throw this into rotation in the future! I received this product for free to review.,2
"Really fun to put on. Nice and thick, feels like it’s gunnu do something good. No stinging or burning. Smells nice.",2
"I love this oil. I have combination skin and am often fighting an oily face, but dry areas. This I put all over, twice a day and my skin is soft and luminous. It layers well beneath makeup (BB cream).",2
"Poorly formulated - this balm separates between the oil components, leaving a mix of oily and chunky textures. This would be forgivable if it was a great cleanser, but it is not. It did not rinse off easily and left a thick layer on my skin that i had to use a face cloth to get off.",0
My go to every day moisturizer I have a dry combo scam. Where is great under make up and really helped with the plumpness of my skin.,2
I revived this #freeproduct from Topbox. I loved this eye cream! I have very dry undereyes and they usually look require a lot of concealer to fix. This product is super hydrating and smoothing and made my under-eye lines disappear,2
"Holy grail product! I have sensitive skin and bad redness. I’ve purchased twice and took advantage when it was a 100 point reward literally cashed in rewards for 6 of them. There hasn’t gone a day when I put makeup that I didn’t use this first. It also makes my skin so glowy! If you have a little redness or a lot, BUY IT!",2
"I have normal but sensitive skin and I tried many different cleansing products in all kinds of textures and from countless different brands. Most of the products did an ok job. Some I couldn’t use during the winter months because they would dry out my skin, some would clog my pores and cause breakouts. A different oil cleanser would leave a layer of oil on my skin (who wants that?), some products require a lot of rubbing, and others just didn’t remove my rarely waterproof make up well enough. However, this oil is simply amazing! It removes daytime makeup with two pumps and heavy evening makeup with two times two pumps. It is also incredibly gentle to the skin and eyes and it leaves my face without any residues of the product or irritated skin! With this product I actually look forward to take my make up off every night! Love this product!!",2
"I’ve used several retinol products before, including prescription Tretinoin and had no problem, but my skin did NOT like this one. Got bumpy skin, redness and severe dryness. Will be throwing this out, super disappointed.",0
"I received 2 trial sizes of this product and fell in love with it immediately. I typically wouldn’t spend this much on one product, but it took only a few days for me to notice a difference in my skin. When I wear this, I have a healthy, more youthful glow and my skin looks so much better! I worried about it making me appear more greasy since I have oily skin, but this hasn’t been the case. I also have extremely sensitive skin and this is gentle on it. I strongly recommend this for those looking  to make skin look more radiant!",2
"I love this toner! I live for the tingle & it makes my skin feel so good after I cleanse it with my Clarisonic. The smell is medicinal at first but addictive & overall it reminds me of Noxzema, I know, so old school.",2
"I honestly really love this eye cream! I was able to try it compliment of Influenster. I like that the cream isn’t too thick and absorbed well. I was worried I couldn’t use it with my foundation, however it wasn’t an issue! Made my eyes feel brighter!",1
"Having been a DDML user for over 20 years, I ordered the new formulation on faith that it would be “new and improved.“ Sorry to say I was sadly disappointed. I don’t see any improvements. The new lotion doesn’t moisturizer as well as the original, and leaves my skin feeling filmy. I have to wonder why Clinique would mess around with a classic best-seller. I think I figured out the answer: I found myself using much more product to adequately cover my face. A bottle lasts me about half as long as the original formula. Marketing 101: one way to increase sales is to sell more often to the existing customer base. This unhappy customer is now searching for a new moisturizer.",0
It’s great at hydrating lips and has a beautiful gloss. Might need to reapply after a few hours but its an amazing balm that smells so nice and fresh.,2
"While I would not call this product a “must have“, I  think it is unique.   It is also great for removing any traces of hair color that finds its way below your hairline onto your face. (no scrubbing required)",1
"After applying a thin layer my makeup stayed on, after spending almost 12 hours on the beach,  going in and out of the water, and sweating.  I love the original,  but this is better.",2
I’ve struggled with cystic acne for years. I’ve never found a more efficient and effective acne product. I cannot recommend this enough it is very well worth it!,2
Did the ten day trial and now enjoying the benefits.  a real improvement.,2
"I am quite torn with this product. It only works when you place it on a pimple that has the big white head exposed. However, the problem that I have with this product is that when you remove it after wearing it overnight, the patch essentially takes the top layer of skin over the white head of the pimple. Idk how healing it is when it just takes off the top and you have to clean the rest of your pimple away. It honestly doesn’t feel much better than just popping the pimple yourself (which we all know not to do), the result after using feels the exact same. Despite all of this, I do find that the recovery is quicker with the dots and the pimple doesn’t travel as much on the face. Overall, not my favourite product for healing my pimples but also not the worst out there.",1
"Amazing moisturizer!!! Just a little expensive, if you’re have dry skin or just patches of dry skin this is the product for you. I have found it best to only use it at night and a lighter product in the morning.",1
"It’s my favourite! I’ve been using this for quite a while now. My skin looks and feels more clear, more vibrant and gets rid of any redness!",2
"Feels nice during application, but aside from that, no results for me.",0
I use this as my nightly moisturizer and I cannot recommend it enough. My skin is glowing every morning!,2
"Best  glycolic serum I have ever tried.  The price is a bit too much, but just one pump is enough for your entire face. I don’t use this every night so this should last me for a good 6 to 8 months",2
This is amazing product I ba every dry skin and by morning this helped my face feel hydrated and healthy! I do have sensitive skin too so finding something that doesn’t burn can be hard but I had no burning or itching either.,2
"Best lip mask ever !! You have to buy, you will not be disappointed",2
"I was looking for the perfect hydrating mask for my dehydrated face during winter. I went to Sephora several time, took 6 different samples in total, including the GlamGlow, FAB - brightening overnight mask and oatmeal mask, etc... And this rose mask is so far the best one. It hydrated my skin, and also it gives me back my glow. I didn’t even need to wear make up the next day :) this mask save me during winter.",2
Holy grail. Makeup melts off. I wish I’d known about this product before I spent years rubbing my face with wipes!,2
"It’s an excellent remover. However for my dry and sensitive skin, noticed more white heads and breakouts. Might be coincidence however, just be careful and do a skin test couple times. I am staying away despite how I liked it as a remover and the oil formula was pleasant to use. :,(",1
Does what it’s supposed to and dulls redness. But a bit heavy feeling and caused me to break out. I’m not generally acne prone but I do have sensitive skin.,1
Smell is very subtle and refreshing. It really helps knock out any dryness or chappedness overnight. It has the slightest fruity taste and smell. Really gets the job done.,2
I really enjoy this product but my only hesitation is the price. Since you are supposed to use a good amount of sunscreen for each application you might run through this bottle pretty fast. When I first put it on it feels greasy but it dries down and makes my skin very moisturized and soft. It has a slight sheen or iridescence to it to give some glow factor on the face.  Overall it’s a nice sunscreen.,1
Very nice product! So glad I️ got This complimentary to try!! Can’t wajt to use it!,2
I have normal to dry skin and I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer I have tried so many different types of moisturizers and this by far has been the best product! It’s a bit pricey but absolutely worth the price. It hydrates my skin and doesn’t leave it oily either the glow on my face is absolutely perfect!,2
"I have used this product for 3 days now and I have noticed a difference in my skin. Yes, it is drying but that can be fixed with a hydrating moisturizer. My skin looks clearer and right after using I definitely feel that my skin is super fresh and clean and like it is doing its job.",1
"I love this sunscreen.  It goes on colorless and clear, no white residue and my concealer and makeup goes on smooth and flawlessly.",2
"I love this product. It smells amazing and takes off all of my makeup. Even my waterproof mascara and eyeliner come off easily with this cleansing balm. It’s great. The only caveat is that it leaves my skin a little greasy afterwards. I have to cleanse again to get the residue off. Otherwise, it’s great for taking makeup off.",1
"I have used it thoroughly before writing this review. My skin is oily recently,  I was worried if deep hydration mask does any change to the skin or increase my acne. Luckily nothing happened. I will keep on using this. Thanks for providing the product.",2
"Saw visible results in just days.  I am 60 years old and the pores seem to be growing wider daily!  After just a couple days use, my makeup went on smoother and the pores were less visible.  Recommend!",2
"I received this product complementary of influencer and  let me just say this product is AMAZING. It leaves your skin so soft, dried quickly and it’s light weight. My skin improved with this product just after a few days of using it. Would definitely recommend to my friends.",2
"Leaves my skin with a beautiful sun kissed glow! My face never matches my body color, so this product was exactly what I needed! Smells great and no orange tint. I had no issues with streaking whatsoever. Very easy to use with an amazing outcome! Gifted by Isle of Paradise",2
I bought fair light because light is too dark and fair is waaaaay too light. I don’t know how but the shade still manages to be too dark. The mate finish was drying on my combination skin and it made my pores look like huge craters on my cheeks. I did not like this at all and I had such high hopes. Other than the shade range and a slight overly dewy finish I loved the regular formula.,1
"I found this toner is very gentle and can be used daily morning and night, it smells really nice and for application I used to use a cotton pad but there’s so much waste with those and they’re not good for the environment (production) so I just shook some into my palm, as recommended, but the first time I thought I needed more than the couple drops I initially got and wasted a bit of product...  You really don’t need a lot and it’s better to go back to it twice than to take too much out at once.    I feel like like it does what the name says, my pore feel smaller and less noticeable and my skin feels hydrated after application.",2
"This is literally the BEST moisturizer I have ever used. I like the smooth texture, the lightness, the smell, just everything about it. It also makes an amazing primer for foundation. LOVE LOVE LOVE! Definitely worth the money.",2
"This product was kindly gifted to me. First of all, I LOVE the packaging and pump dispenser. I personally hate pots/tubs as packaging because it feels unsanitary dipping my fingers straight into the product, so the pump dispenser is perfect. This moisturizer is super creamy and pretty thick - usually I’m a lightweight moisturizer girl but I will definitely reach for this in the colder months when my skin gets super dry. It’s very hydrating and makes my skin feel super soft. I also like that it’s unscented.",1
"My sleep schedule has been all out of whack since switching to work night shift. Since receiving this sample I’ve used it before bed in the morning after a long shift. I apply just under the eye and feel super refreshed after waking up. This does not cake on the skin, there’s really no need to rinse! I would recommend.",2
$25 for 1 tube. it works; but this small tube doesn’t last you very long,1
This is the best makeup removing balm. It gets rid off all my eye makeup and face makeup super easy. Including those stubborn waterproof mascara and faults lashes glue. I highly recommend this to anyone.,2
I like how it’s nice and thick but doesn’t feel heavy on my skin. My skim feels soft and hydrated when I use this.,2
I bought it back in 2020 & used it frequently (mostly just once a day). I just finished it and what made me rly like this cleanser was that I had gotten my nose pierced & decided to not wash my face until it healed well this time. I have oily/combination skin & boy did my face get SUPER oily throughout those weeks! I started getting lots of bumps on my t-zone area so I decided to finally wash my face & boy did my face clear up so much in less than a week! Super impressed! 4 stars cuz I’ve always had “good” skin before using this so idk how well it worked besides that incident.,1
"You know the feeling, when you wake up and your face is very soft, moisturizer and fresh looking?This cream doesn’t do it for me. Unfortunately. It smells amazing and it doesn’t make me break out, but I’m just looking for more moisturizing night creams/masks. And it’s not it.",1
I really didn’t enjoy the scent it reminded me of baby wipes. It does help moisturize dry skin.,1
"You don’t understand how much I love this stuff. It’s so hydrating and feels so luxurious on my skin. A little goes a long way. I’ve tried other moisturizers from Glow Recipe and First Aid Beauty and this one is my favorite by far. Might be a little overly moisturizing for oily skin especially during summer, but it works really well for my skin. The smell is also lovely and not bothersome.",2
"I received the Watermelon Glow Pink Juice Moisturizer complimentary from Glowrecipe in exchange for a review. Thank you Glowrecipe for giving me a chance to try this item.Claims: A gel-emulsion that absorbs instantly to seal hydration and prep skin.Notable Ingredients: Watermelon, Hyaluronic Acid, Jasmine and Peony Extract.Use:  Pink Juice can be used as your daily moisturizer, morning and night. For people with oily/combo skin it can be used as a moisturizer and be used as a serum for people with dry skin.This is the first time I’ve tried this moisturizer and so far I’m loving it. It was a faint scent of fresh watermelon which I usually hate but I don’t mind it in this. My skin is combo/dry and the moisturizer feels pretty light and absorbs easily into the skin. During the day I do use it as a moisturizer before adding my SPF.  I usually don’t use any foundation so I’m not sure how this works work as a primer base.During the evening I use it as a moisturizing essence. I love how my skin feels after using it, moisturized without feeling tacky or greasy. So far I’ve been pretty impressed with this moisturizer and might try more items from this range.Rating: 5/5",2
This feels great on my skin. My skin feels less dry and smoother. I like how light it feels. I’m very happy with this,2
"This cleanser had a really good feel to it. When you’re lathering it in your hand it thick but then become rally foamy (is that a word? Lol) my face felt great and soft after. I have Combination skin, so I’m really glad it left a nice clean surface that wasn’t dry or oily as some other cleansers tend to do. It also had a great smell which was much appreciated. I tried this cleanser as a free product.",2
"This moisturizer is THICK! I have normal to oily skin and I’ve found it best to only use this at night because it takes a while to soak in. A little goes a long way too! I also don’t think that makeup would perform well on top of it. That being said, it is very moisturizing and I wake up the next day with softer skin. The packaging is beautiful and the product has no dyes or artificial scent. Not my everyday go-to, but I like putting it on when my skin needs a little overnight TLC.",1
This is the perfect moisturizer. It’s not too thick and not too thin. Great for every day use. I bought it a couple months back. I can’t say enough good things about this. I only felt like it ran out too quickly. It has a weird pump distribution. It must do that to prevent bacteria but I would like to see when I’m getting close to the end of a product. I was very surprised one day that I was totally out.,2
This serum is a really good effective serum. It does exactly what it says it does. Also I’m very acne prone and usually I break out very easily with trying new products but I did not break out from this serum. It has a nice lightweight feel and a great texture its very hydrating. The only issue i have is I personally feel like its a small amount of product in the bottle especially for the price. Even though i do love it!,1
"My favorite for years was Creme Da Lamer, no longer.MAGIC CREME IS A SOUFFLE OF SILK ON YOUR SKIN.",2
I have struggled with acne all my life and his has cleared me up!! Thank you Sephora for caring it in your store!!,2
"This product is so smilie t and hydrating, has the beat smell and is just the perfect under makeup base! I love it!!!",2
Made my dry damaged lips soft and plumped for the whole day!! It looks like a lip gloss but feels like a smooth chap stick!! I’m a swimmer and I could still feel this on my lips after the pool!! It also has spf which is awesome for protecting your lips!! It’s lightweight and creamy!! I have the scent original. I’m obsessed with this product!! Will buy again and again,2
"Such a cute and lovely moisturiser! I love the gel texture it’s super lightweight, very hydrating and my skin is definitely plumed and looking glowing after applying.I also like to apply this before makeup, as it makes my skin smooth and ready for the foundation,  and the foundation will apply well on skin and no dry patches like when I don’t hydrate my face enough.",2
"Nice hydrating base for makeup. Went on smooth and did not feel heavy at all. It wore nicely under my foundation and gave an overall nice finish to my makeup. A little goes a long way, so this should last me for a while!",1
"Smells good, feels good! I was looking for a moisturizing facial spray that was not a toner (this is part-toner) but decided to give this a try after reading favorable reviews. I usually use Super coconut quench by Perricone which comes in a nice 4 oz bottle. I would prefer that but this Caudalie spray does well. I will probably try another spray next time just to see...",1
This scrub left my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. By far the best facial scrub I have ever used!,2
"Not exactly impressed with the product, much less with the price.  I just see what the big deal about this product is.",1
"I received this as a free sample from Influenster. I am so happy that I was part of this voxbox because I was in need of a new moisturizer! What I was even more greatful about was the fact that it’s mattifying which is perfect for me considering I have an oily complexion.When I received this product I realized the scent was rose. I am not a big fan of the rose scent, but when I opened the jar it smelled absolutely amazing. It smelled like rose with a little citrusy scents mixed in. The mind of smell you would expect a grapefruit scent to have. When I apply it to my skin the smallest amount goes a long way. I didn’t realize that until after I put on a couple of swipes on my face. One tap of your finger in the pot and I think it should be good to cover your entire face. It has a cooling feeling when I put it on my skin, but that could be because my skin usually feels hot. Either way it feels refreshing on my skin. It has given me a subtle matte glow. My skin had improved over the past couple of weeks (not because of this product since I had just received it) so I don’t wear foundation when I go to school anymore. I just dab some moisturizer on my skin after sunscreen of course, a little mascara and lipstick or chapstick and highlight if I’m in the mood and I’m good to go. I hope this product continues to make my skin feel soft because once I finish it I will be going to purchase it at Sephora! If your skeptical about the product I suggest asking Sephora for a sample or 2 so you could try it before you buy it. You won’t be disappointed though trust me!",2
"Doesn’t make me break out, but I don’t like the consistency-- too runny. I like thick gels (wish Clinique would make one, like Lancome’s!) or scrubs, that really stay on till I feel like my face is clean. I would use it in the morning to refresh but not at night to take off makeup, sunscreen, dirt, etc.",1
I love this product soooo much I will never go back to another cleanser. It is so light and refreshing and smells amazing. Cleans without making the skin feel stripped or tight. I do have pretty normal skin without many specific concerns so it might be better for that skin type.,2
"For 5 years I’ve been trying to find a good hydrator for my skin type (dry-combo) and also one that won’t make me break out even more because I also suffer from acne. Then I met this moisturizer.I’m not kidding, I will never buy a new hydrator. Wears nicely under my makeup, never makes it cakey or splotchy. My complex looks almost instantly better. I look more awake and more plump!",2
"I love this stuff! I’m fairly new to Clinique products and I bought this after reading great reviews. It melts off all my makeup and is one of VERY few make up removers that I can use on my eyes without my eyelids getting rough, dry, scaly, red, burning patches. I follow it up with the Clinique 3 step system for Combo/Oily skin and my skin has not been this clear in a very long time!",2
Awesome product if used as directed! Would absolutely buy again,2
"I was having trouble with dry skin even though I used moisturizer daily.  Since I started using Aqua Bomb, I have soft, supple skin.  It really does flood your skin and feels wonderful on.  I wish it smelled a little better, but that’s something that can be overlooked.",2
Great for sensitive skin ... does not dry the skin.,1
Works well. I use Belif brand last two months and it’s my favourite. I can see improvement in quality of my skin.,2
"I have a fair to light complexion and freckles. I was worried this would be too dark when the color changed, like most other “adapt to your skin tone“ products. Not the case. This works amazingly.Like everyone else, I ordered this treatment to help combat excessive redness on my face and skin. I was skeptical, but I tried it on the reddest part of my body, my chest, and IMMEDIATELY the redness went away. I was shocked. You can see my skin, and not just the blotchy redness. I plan on wearing this next time I get a foundation match, as you can now see my yellow undertones-- the possibility of no longer being pegged as cool toned straight away is ridiculously exciting!",2
I have been using the Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Pore Perfecting Serum for about two weeks now and I have noticed a difference in my nose pores. My pores have gotten smaller and I’m hoping that with continuous use they will continue to shrink. I would recommend to anyone interested in this product.,2
Love Love Love. This is a must have. Good moisture for the lips,2
I have extremely chapped lips and I’ve tried every lip balm ever and they don’t compare to this product I absolutely adore this!,2
"I used this after cleansing and toning my skin. I do like that it doesn’t contain any fragrance, parabens, dyes, or mineral oils. It worked decently for me - it didn’t make my face feel oily or sticky. It felt smooth and lightweight going on. A little bit went a long way. However, this wasn’t a total standout product for me. I may or may not purchase again.",1
"I’ve only used this twice so far but it’s amazing! Really helps clear up your skin if you have a breakout but it leaves your face feeling soft and moist instead of dried out. AND a little goes a long way--you can definitely get a lot of masks out of this. All around, much better than GlamGlow in my opinion!",2
Love. Clears dead skin for very smooth makeup application. I use this once a week.,2
Love the lightweight consistency of this product. It’s not overly fragrant and it absorbs nicely into the skin.,2
"I have very oily skin, with acne scares and redness! after just one use my skin feels so smooth and is 60% more clearer.",2
I wanted more out of this product. I have medium sized pores on my nose. They always have congestion and when squeezed you see results. I thought this product may take place of squeezing... not so. Only 2 little areas showed any reaction to the strip. Disappointed in the result for the price.,1
"I really liked that product. It makes my skin around the eyes very smooth. It doesn’t have any unpleasant smell, it is super easy to apply. I like to use it before bed time so I can feel retinol effect in the morning. I would definitely recommend it",2
"I received this Fresh Black Tea Age Renewal Cream complimentary from Fresh and I am obsessed! It is incredibly hydrating and nourishing, especially on my dry skin this winter. The firming peptides make my face look so snatched, so I love using it before applying foundation. You will love this hydrating cream if you are concerned about aging or have mature skin.",2
"I’ve been through a lot of facial cleansers, searching for the perfect fit for my skin, which is super sensitive, but also fairly dry. This is the first one I’ve used that works for my skin and that I don’t mind using every day. It’s a soy product, so the smell was hard to get used to at first, but the way my skin feels is.... awesome.",1
I am in love with this oil!!! Heard a lot of good things about noni. It works well with Gua Sha. I can feel my skin is glowing.,2
"Hydrating and moisturizing, what more can you ask for from a facial cream? I have dry skin and really enjoy using this facial cream with squalane in it. It is a heavier cream in texture but doesn’t feel heavy on the face. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave my skin greasy. I still enjoy using it during our hot Socal summers. My skin feels great when I use this cream and the effects are long-lasting. I don’t feel any tightness until the next time I wash my face. I also find that this makes my skin feel softer and helps fill in fine lines by hydrating my skin. I like that there is squalane in here as I’m always trying to incorporate highly effective ingredients and have heard great things about squalane.",2
"The new dew drops (gifted by Glow Recipe) do in fact give a dewiness without mica! There is a slight watermelon scent but it’s not too overpowering, the formula is very light and wearable. I definitely look forward to layering this underneath my foundation or just wearing it on a no makeup day!",2
"The most amazing product, I love it. It just make my skin feel soft and young. Caudalie are great products",2
love love love! this stuff!! I really do regret not buying this sooner. Will be a must from now on.,2
"My skin felt very soft, but it clogged my pores and gave me pimples. I don’t get pimples anymore but this was just a clog-fest. Tried it on different occasions, and same thing.",0
"This is only my second day wearing this moisturizer but I am IN LOVE. I have dry skin that sucks all the moisture out of any product and despite having moisturizer as the main star in my bedtime routine I usually wake up feeling dry again... Not this time!!! I could actually feel the moisture in my skin this morning! I used this product again during my morning routine, hours later after many errands and mommy stuff I touched my skin and my skin was noticeably softer and hydrated! Belief has definitely won a new customer!",2
HOLY grail serum!!!! Absolutely love it,2
I’m a huge fan of Charlotte Tilbury products and this cream is no exception. I love putting it on before my makeup. My skin type is dry and this makes me feel more moisturized and prepped before putting my foundation on. It’s not greasy like some other creams I’ve used which is ideal since I apply it before my makeup!,2
"I bought the trial size version of ExfoliKate at Sephora thinking I would be as disappointed with it as I had been with every single other exfoliating product I had tried on my dry, sensitive skin. I was wrong...ExfoliKate is a real winner and a game changer among exfoliators. With my first use, I was rewarded with soft, dewy skin that had such a fantastic glow to it that I didn’t even wear makeup the next day. I loved this product so much I have since purchased two moisturizers from this line and I have plans to expand my collection. Although pricey, ExfoliKate more than delivers and I will definitely repurchase the full size once I run out of the trial size tube. ExfoliKate = Incredible!",2
Love this! Goes on light and does not irritate my eyes. You only need a little bit each time.,2
"I’m in that in-between stage that you often get in your thirties where you are still getting breakouts but also battling the first signs of aging, and it is difficult to find products that provide clarity and softness to the skin. This manage to do both. It is an essential part of my routine now. It has kept my face moisturized during the winter and improved my skin tone, no doubt. I use it almost every night to take off makeup, followed up by an antioxidant-rich cleanser, then a night time treatment that varies depending on what my skin needs at the time. This stuff is amazing.",2
"I got a sample of this product today with my points, and I tried it on after I removed my makeup and cleansed my face..this is AMAZING. I have really oily skin, and this really impressed me! It makes my skin feel super smooth and matte, and somehow my oils disappear yet this product continues to hydrate my skin. I am so exited to try this on before applying my foundation. It would be an amazing primer/moisturizer. I really recommend this to people with combination/oily skin!!!!",2
"These dots are an excellent overnight treatment to help heal emerging or continuing blemishes. For anxious pickers like me, they give you a way to leave it alone overnight and wake up with less there to tempt you in the morning. You can trust that it’s doing it’s job. They have definitely helped reduce redness and swelling for me. Not a miracle cure, and not all that effective with rosacea-like spots, but overall the best product of its kind that I’ve used.",1
I received this and was gifted this in a voxbox and I really liked it. i have sensitive skin and it worked pretty well and better than others i’ve tried. I also love the price point and the company so i love. definitely recommend.,1
"Love using these once a week at night — it helps rid of so much oil and gunk in my T zone and my chin! I was definitely skeptical, but t actually works! The whole strip is nearly white every time (it’s gross but satisfying), and I’ve recently placed a new order to stock up on them. Would definitely recommend!",2
Only peeling product I mad about. My skin feels like silk with it. Really worth it.,2
"Over the years I have suffered far too many cold sores from sun exposure. Because of that, the shape of my upper lip outline was scarred and at one point seemingly invisible. There seemed to be no delineation between the lip and the skin above it. I purchased a multi-piece kit with this in it and foolishly let it sit in my drawer for a few weeks. Eventually I used it a few times at night and couldn’t believe my eyes! The outline of my scarred lip area returned! The underneath scars are still there, but I now have actual upper lip definition in the area where before it was like someone had erased it. I have tried the similar formulations which come in the brown tube or the colored variations (such as rose’), but the Advanced Therapy is the ONLY Fresh lip product and product of its kind that I have ever had actually HEAL my lip area. I recommend it to all of my friends and have to hide it from my daughter! I hope Fresh NEVER stops producing this amazing product!!",2
"I was hesitant about trying this because of the cost, but I’ve used it daily for only one week so far and my skin looks and feels fabulous! I used to get chemical peels at a spa and got burned, but this feels just fine after second step is applied. My skin is smoother, less oily, unclogs pores, and dark spots are lightening after just a short time of use. Compared to professional peels, this is a great value and I think gives great results that are comparable. Definitely agree about avoiding lips, my upper lip has gotten a little chapped but nothing severe, just be careful when applying. Love this product!",2
I used this serum for more than 15 days . But didn’t see any change,0
So moisturizing I love it. Did not break my sensitive skin out. If you have skin on the dryer side you definitely still need a moisturizer but you may not for normal/dry skin.,2
"A must have for aging skin! I’ve seen reduced pores and vanishing fine lines! This product is a no brainer! I received it in a voxbox from Influenster, but I’ve been using it since long before, but now I have it in a travel size! So that’s exciting. My daily routine will never be without this product. I discovered it when I realized my skin was like a stranger to me all of a sudden. It transitioned on me somewhere between 38 and 40. On my quest to keep my skin healthy and elastic I found this. It’s a beautiful, lightweight and refreshing liquid. It doesn’t have any of the chemically-ness that some other brands do. It also leaves your face feeling fresh and clean. I can’t say enough about the visible improvements I’ve seen. This product found its way quickly to the top of my essentials list!",2
Laneige is not cruelty free! They do test on animals!,0
"This product is my first experience with an under eye mask and although I don’t have anything to compare it to, I really like the results. I’ve used it beneath my eyes as well as on my forehead - the two dry spots on my face, and the thick consistency really keeps my skin hydrated. So far the results have been smoother, less puffy skin - I look forward to continuing to use it!",1
Loooove using this cleanser 1-2 times a week. I need salicylic acid in my routine for my pores and acne that pops up here and there. This makes my face feel SO clean after and definitely helps keep any breakouts at bay.,2
"I have the most sensitive skin, but it’s also dry, prone to sunburn, and I get weird cystic acne and blackheads, whiteheads for seemingly no reason.This cleanser makes everything alright! Lathers nicely, bottle lasts for awhile, and leaves my skin so soft and calm and clean.",2
Love everything about this product - it works so well exfoliating my face. I use it about every few days in the morning after washing my face. It leaves my skin glowing and makes my face feel so fresh and clean! The smell is a light citrusy scent. Definitely pricy but a little bit goes a long way! I envision this lasting me a few months and will most likely purchase more when I run out,2
This stuff works wonders for my lips and other dry spots. Also putting it on my cuticles make them wonderful!,2
I love this balm. It doesn’t go on greasy at all and leaves a nice subtle smell.,1
Haven’t used consistently but I like what it does to my skin for the times I have used it,1
"I use this as both a primer and sometimes a moisturizer. It helped the appearance of my eczema under make up and I love it! The only reason that I’m not giving it 5 stars is because the perfume could irritate some skin types depending on sensitivity. Overall I would give this product a try! I received it as a sample at first, loved it so much I had to buy the full size.",2
"i seen a tiktok that a girl uses this for her armpits and she doesn’t smell or have BO or anything.. i didn’t believe it until my friend bought it for us to try it because it’s so affordable.. cheaper then most deodorants.. so i been using it for over a month and i’ll say the first two weeks i didn’t use deodorant because i felt like i didn’t really need it but with the warm summer coming, i’m starting to spray with on then put deodorant on and there is no smell, excess sweat or anything..",2
Great lactic acid it makes my skin so smooth! I love the ordinary products and the prices are even better.,2
I really wanted to like this product. I have very dry skin and hair and was hoping this would work. I do like the product but i didnt think it was really any better than anything else ive used. It didnt seem to do anything at all for my hair. I tried to use it to moisturize my skin but it didnt seem to rub in very well. I basically use it on my face but like i said doesnt seem to work any better than any other product ive used.,0
"I don’t know if I got a bad one, but the texture of mine is grainy/scratchy. It comes out separated between a pool of oil and the thicker  balm part. The packaging makes it impossible to get the product out when it gets close to the bottom.The ordinary cleanser if so much nicer and for a lower price.",0
absolutely incredible. i feel like an absolute angel every time i put this mask on. my skin always feels super hydrated and the rose scent is so calming. would definitely recommend!,2
"Hated it, made my face so much more sensible and reactive, stopped using it after maybe 3 times and the smell was really strong",0
"absolutely the best- My skin loves this oil so much!!  It’s unbelievable what a difference this oil has made.  I use a couple little drops in the morning and at night every day.  Since I started, my skin is brighter, smoother, clearer, and healthier.  It has a very faint scent of rose.  it’s just perfect!!",2
great glossy balm for an everyday use!!!highly suggest,2
"- I use this primarily to remove my eye makeup. I wear a lot of black eyeliner and eye shadow and the oil removes it easily and quickly, w/o leaving me with the raccoon eyes.- I’ve been prone to a dry eye area (slight eczema) and find that the oil doesn’t strip my skin of moisture.- I’m a contact lens wearer, so my eyes are somewhat sensitive to cleaners. JM’s cleansing oil does not leave my eyes irritated at all, which is fantastic. I didn’t know a non-irritating eye makeup remover existed!- Just a note: the cleanser didn’t turn milky or foamy after adding water.This oil is thicker than Shu Uemura’s cleansing oil, so it’s a little difficult to spread if you don’t have an adequate amount. I need about 1 full pump for both eyes. Hence, the 4 stars, because I think the bottle will be used up quickly and it’s on the expensive side.",1
I have redness-prone combination skin which changes drastically with the seasons. I used rosehip oil throughout the winter as the last step in my before-bed skincare routine. I decided to choose a lighter oil for Springtime and got this. It’s quite good so far (a month in). I pat it on after moisturiser and it keeps moisture in without triggering my acne. I do get the occasional pimple but this and the rosehip oil before it seem to speed the healing process.,1
"I’ve been looking for a new primer and received this from Influenster complimentary to review. I am hooked. The smell is so fresh, almost lemon scented. It’s oil free which is perfect because I have oily and very sensitive skin and this has been great. My make up goes on very smoothly and it feels like I can use less foundation even. I work 12 hour shifts and my makeup is still on at the end of my shift. This is my first time using a Tatcha product and I am very impressed.",2
"I love the small bottle and carry it with me everywhere. I especially love to spray it on when I travel. If I have a long flight I will spritz it on in the middle of the flight and right when we land and I feel so hydrated. I also like to spray it on my face when I am out on the town to refresh my make up, especially when I go out drinking. It keeps my face feeling fresh and wakes me up.",2
"This stuff is honestly the best makeup remover I have ever used. It takes all of my makeup clean off, even my mascara. The highlight is it washes off without leaving behind residue or oil. My only slight criticism is the packaging. It’s a twist off (not ideal for having my hands in oil) and I don’t love have to dip back in if I want more product. It’s a 4.8 on my scale, almost perfect.",2
"I love the texture and the way it feels. However, when I put it on it leaves like a metallic finish and I hate how my skin looks. It may be better for anyone who has dry/combination skin but overall it’s a good product.",1
"WoW this stuff is the best make up remover for me. I tend to wear heavy makeup and was concerned this wouldn’t do the job but it got all my makeup, sunscreen and whatever else I had put on my face earlier in the day. It did feel somewhat greasy but I was able to easily wash it away from rinsing enough water over my face. My face felt super clean after and so glad I tried this product. I have had much success with DE products for my skin so maybe I just got lucky with this one, as I see in the comments a lot of ppl didn’t like it or didn’t work on them. I highly recommend!",2
"I love the way this makes my face feel very hydrated and fresh. I like to use this when I feel that my skin is dry and needs some moisture. It is a bit pricey however it is a 2 in 1 that you are getting. I also use the moisturizer during the daytime to give me a little extra hydration. Overall, I would recommend this to someone that has dry skin and wants to add hydration. Disclaimer: I received this product for complimentary purposes through infester.",1
I can not say enough good things about this product! I have extremely dry skin and this has changed my skin majorly after only 3 weeks of use. Every other moisturizer I have tried has worked but always left me feeling meh about it. This one is seriously worth the investment. If you can only afford to splurge on one product I would choose this one !!,2
I absolutely love this moisturizer! It’s thin but seems into my skin leaving it ultra hydrated with a very pleasant scent! It’s lightweight but powerful!,2
"Smells awful! Got a sample of this. The product itself is super milky and light weight, but didn’t do much for my skin at all. The smell is absolutely dreadful and is nauseating, I don’t think I could ever get past that, no matter how good the product is. It made my skin slightly softer but nothing too special, plus it’s super pricy.",0
The best lip balm for on the go! I love how large it is! Must buy!!,2
"I liked the lightness of this cream. It has a gel like texture. I really like the smell of this product, it is citrusy. It works well and absorbs nicely. I would say if you want to see results very fast this is not it. I can see some improvements with my dark circles. Hydration is normal nothing crazy.",1
"I have combination and sensitized skin and mild acne on my forehead. I am in love with this product! It literally makes my skin glow after the 1st use and I still get that glow every time now. I do feel a slight stinging, but very mild and I have sensitive skin so I’m sure a lot of people don’t feel it. My acne has been better since using this product. Less breakouts and it’s helping to clear some of the residual old breakouts.One downside is that your fingers sometimes peel from where you hold the pad due to the glycolic and salicylic acid, but that’s something I’d deal with to use this product.LOVE IT!!",2
I love this is so good on dry skin very hydrating and it gives you glass skin. My skin feels more firm great for under eyes. I always repurchase its amazing great for wrinkles,2
I’ve used this product before and noticed a big difference in the softness of my skin. it really helps the skincare after to be better absorbed into the skin. I will say it is quite pricey though and I feel like other essences can do the same effect of softening,1
I understand why this essence is super popular here and all over Asia ! It’s super light and lovely and sinks into my skin easily. After using the toner I also feel my skin plump and brightened,1
"I really like this product, but I’m not in love with it. The smell on it is amazing and it is definetly hydrating. However, it is a little too sticky for my personnal liking and it doesn’t stay long after the application (30 minutes maximum)",1
"I use this product in combination with their Ultra Repair Hydrating Serum and I must say it is amazing! I’ve tried countless creams and moisturizers, I have very sensitive and extremely dry skin and this seems to be my holy grail. Together with the serum they work magic and have made my rosacea calm down. My skin feels hydrated and soothed after using.",2
"I was gifted by Fresh and have been using the cream for a week and I am enjoying the texture ,smell and the feel on my skin.It stays long and my skin feels well moisturized for longer which is much needed right now in the winter time. I shared some with my mom and she is loving it.",2
"This moisturizer is super lightweight & does not clog my pores! My skin feels so nice & refreshed after I use it. I put it on at night & before I put make up on, and it leaves this really nice radiance to my skin. Definitely repurchasing!",2
"This exfoliator is amazing for my sensitive, dry skin. I don’t know why I held off on trying it out. So glad I did.",2
"I’ve used this product for years, never have I been disappointed. I have combination skin and it has managed to keep my skin clear for as long as I have used it. I know the price is a bit up there, but in my opinion it is well worth it.",2
This product smells like a lemon treat! It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and looking glowy. You only need a pea size amount which means it will last upwards of 6 months.,2
"Tatcha makes a beautiful product inside and out. The packaging and presentation is flawless. As to the product, love that it has clean ingredients. The first night I used it my face looked instantly brighter but haven’t noticed a huge change since then. I do think the longer I use it, the more I’ll see results. I’ll report back then! Please note I did receive this product complimentary to provide a review.",1
"Excellent product.  More like 4.5 stars.  It actually will stay on your lips all night, like something marketed as a mask should.I have dry, dehydrated skin and my lips are no exception.  I regularly exfoliate and I still can get dry patches on my lips, especially in the winter.  This really helps.I’d REALLY love this product even more if it wasn’t flavored.I like that it comes with a little applicator for sanitary reasons; however, I wish that the applicator came with a way to attach it to the lid.  I took a dollop of hot glue and stuck the little plastic container for the applicator to the top of the lid, which works.",2
"Defiantly a top, high end primer that like their other products lives up to its claims, but still very pricey for a primer....I will say it is a good sized product though",1
"Thank you, Kiehl’s!!! I am SO glad to have discovered this product. My skin is very oily, sensitive, and I have cystic acne (active and scarring) and rosacea. Needless to say, I get very nervous about trying new skincare products; even sensitive brands sometimes make my skin go into total meltdown mode.NOT THIS. This is incredible! First of all, the lavender makes me feel like I’m at a spa and helps me sleep at night. Second of all, there is clearly a noticeable difference between when I put this on the night before and when I didn’t. If I’ve put it on, my skin looks more even, hydrated, my acne scars have lightened and my active breakouts usually look less angry. Plus, I just feel positive about doing something kind for my skin.When I haven’t put this on before bed, I wake up to new breakouts, more intense hyper-pigmentation and discoloration, and I also have weirdly dry cheeks with an excessively oily T-zone.Morals of the story: this is worth every penny, I will be a customer for life, and don’t be scared to use an oil just because you have oily skin.",2
I received this product free for my honest review from Influenster. I love Estée Lauder products. This cream has a light scent which I like. It’s not a thin moisturizer but not super thick. It feels nice on my face. It adds hydration that my skin sometimes lacks. The sample size is small so I didn’t have enough product to test it out fully. I don’t know all the benefits but I’m sure they are great. The hydration was an instant benefit for me. I only got about four days worth of product.,2
"I received a free sample of Dr. Dennis Gross’ Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel. While the product seems fantastic, I only received a three day sample, so I don’t feel that’s truly enough time to thoroughly notice whether it’s working as it should. I did notice my skin glowed and looked plumper on the nights I used the product, so I do feel it would be effective. I have used Dr. Dennis Gross’ products in the past and I’m a huge fan so I’d definitely recommend it to anyone on the fence about trying this or any other of his products.",2
This is one of my favorite serums by far. It changed the texture of my skin and you can really see the smoothness and decreased pore size. I would totally recommend!,2
"I love this mask! It leaves my skin feeling so smooth, soft, and looking so much brighter and clearer. It’s a no-hassle mask and as a clay mask it does make your skin feel tight as it dries on your skin, but not uncomfortably so as some clay masks do. I use a lot of masks and enjoy trying new ones, but this one will always be my go-to.",2
"I received a deluxe sample of this product two months ago and recently just ordered the full size. I have combination skin, and a little of this product goes a long way. Its very smooth going on and really feels like your skin “drinks“ it in. It leaves my skin very soft and it’s easy to apply makeup over it. The only downside is I wish it had SPF",2
I love this 100% Argan Oil,2
I was gifted by Dermalogica. I love this cleansing oil from Dermalogica!! I own a lot of their products so I was so excited to try this one! It cleans my face without over drying it and still leaves it feeling amazing soft and hydrated. This works on all skin types too which I love. I’ll be buying more when I’m done with this bottle!!,2
"I’m just going to come right out and say it- this is not a great makeup remover. There are certainly times you could use this to remove your makeup, yes, and it will come off. But this product is so, so much more effective when you remove your makeup prior to using it. Now, when you remove your makeup before hand... Wow! What a beautiful cleanser. Hydrating but not oily, refreshing and soothing for sensitive skin, creamy and luxurious. Really fantastic for those of you with skin types who are also sensitive to harsh products (i.e. Oily-Sensitive, Dry-Sensitive). It is gentle while still being effective. I wouldn’t say it decreases my blemishes, but it certainly doesn’t contribute to them, and it has definitely helped reduce redness and made my skin very smooth. I also love the smell (though don’t be fooled, it’s not so perfume-y that my sensitive skin would break out)! I used this for such a long time, and I only switched because of the price. But if you don’t mind splurging a little bit for a lot of product, I would highly recommend it!Overall...Pros:- gentle but effective- great for sensitive skin- makes your skin feel fantastic- smells awesome- good for all skin typesCons:- not a good makeup remover- pricey- doesn’t aid with blemishes",1
Didn’t fix my breakouts.. calmed them down but not worth a repurchase.,1
This facewash is very light and creamy feeling and leaves my face feeling fresh. I like that it doesn’t take alot of product in order to get my face clean.,1
Lovely. Moisturizes intensely without feeling heavy. Will purchase again,2
"I always check reviews, and the ones for this are on point. I use it the day before a special outing and my skin is glowing. I would recommend!",2
"When my skin was just feeling and looking crappy, this came in the mail and changed my face for the better. After just 2 days, my skin was actually less oily but more brighter. I may have found my next favorite cleanser!",2
"First off, I think the fact that you mix it yourself is an awesome part of it. It makes it seem much more fresh and potent to your skin. I’ve been using this to dull and fade my acne scars along with azealic acid & im impressed with the quick results! It doesn’t smell that great, but that isn’t a huge factor to me. Just make sure to layer with your sunscreen!",2
"I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica. This cleansing oil has a thin oily consistency and a light fresh citrus scent. It is very effective at removing even the fullest coverage makeup. I have been using this cleansing oil with a reusable makeup remover cloth as the first step in my double cleansing routine every evening. It leaves my skin clean, refreshed, hydrated, and glowing. I think the price is really fair as well. Overall, I really like this pre-cleanse and would recommend it!",2
"A brightening, lightweight moisturizer that hydrates the skin while also leavening behind a healthy glow. Also has a great watermelon smell that is not too overwhelming. I have dry skin and overall this helped soothe and hydrate my skin. This product was kindly gifted to me from the brand for an honest review.",2
Love Caudalíe and many of their products. I thought that this spray was pretty good. I still use a great rose water by Mario most but both are great for an instant calming mist. My only issues with Grape Water is it doesn’t smell as good and it takes more than one spray to get good coverage. Still great for a cool down.,1
I absolutely love this stuff! It feels so refreshing and cool. The smell is another perk! My skin is super soft and hydrated after only one use this morning. Would definitely recommend! Excited to try my under eye rescue patches by Tarte now.,2
"I bought the sample size and i must say, i love it! So far, i only used it in my hair, and it makes my dry frizzy and curly hair so silky soft! The only downside is the price, but it’s definitly Worth it!",2
"I heard about this product being raved about in the beauty community so I was very excited when I got it as a complimentary product through Influenster! I think overall it is a pretty good product. The scent is appealing. The consistency itself feels quite like Vaseline and I find it to be gone after a short time. It does leave your lips looking nice and plump while it’s on but after it is removed, I don’t see much change in the condition of my lips.",1
Great addition to my night routine. Beautiful application that just glides onto your skin. Plumps skin and makes me look refreshed in the morning. Worth it!,2
I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I was really impressed with this serum! It instantly made my skin feel tighter and softer. It didn’t break my face out and really helped with some of the discoloration. My only criticism is the smell. Not fond of it. I do believe I would need to try this more than just a week to truly know how well I like it (I only received a week supply).,1
This serum is worth every cent. I have struggled with minor breakouts and an overall uneven skin. My skin would come close to being clear but then it would be really red or a pimple I had would take a while to completely go away (slightly scar). I got a sample of this with a purchase and within 1-2 weeks I noticed a much better complexion and that my skin really really cleared up. I haven’t had to use foundation in almost a month now bc this makes my skin very even and healthy looking. I use it every morning and night before moisturizing. Photo is after using moisturizer (Sephora brand instant moisture+cream hyaluronic acid booster)  with no make up on,2
"I received this #freeproduct for review from #trywithtopbox. This eye cream goes on so smooth, and you only need to use small amount. has nice scent and love how it moisturizes under eyes so well. Glad I was able to try it and may consider buying thee full product.",2
Love this product! Melts the makeup right off and leaves no greasy residue!,2
"I absolutely adore it. I love how it feels on my skin, and how silky the application is. I will say it has a bit of a scent, but I genuinely enjoy it! (I love lightly scented things for sure!) it works well before makeup use, and it makes my skin look and feel amazing! I will say the price is a bit high, but I’m sure it’s because a little goes a super long way on it. I was sent a sample for free, but wholeheartedly would pay for something this good!",2
"I was using this product ever since i bought it. I love it, It helps to remove the dead skin that appeals after the soap. At first, the smell and the itch aren’t that pleasing but it took me no very long before getting used to it and now I love it.",2
"I recieved this product t complimentary for testing purposes and I just want to say I adore this line. I’ve used this line before but never this product.it has increased moisture to my face and since it’s been so cold and dry for the winter, it’s helped my chapped skin rejuvenate. The smell is incredible too. It smells like cucumber and lime. It’s a must have to you skincare routine I liked this product especially for night moisture because in the morning when you wake up you notice a difference in your skin and how it feels. It’s incredible to say the least.",2
I got this product thanks to influenster! I’ve been using it for a little over a week and this sleeping mask is light and it feels great on the face. I have normal to dry skin and when I put it on at night it has a refreshing feel to it and I wake up with a brighter looking face. The smell I did not like it took some getting used to but the plus is that A little goes a long way!,2
"I fell in love with this cream the first time I used it. The pearlescent color of it and the light fragrance of it was a good first impression followed by the creamiest consistency when putting it on. Most of my moisturizer creams are of a watery, thin nature but this goes on so well and holds it “moisturized” feel for hours. It made my skin feel so soft and plump, I even used it on my neck. I feel, after using it twice a day for a week now, that it has dramatically reduced my fine lines and wrinkles on my face.",2
I think that this product works fairly well however if you have fairly good skin I would not use it because it can just damage your skin. For people with more skin issues this is a very good product to use.,1
"Like so many other reviewers, I wanted to hate this, or for it not to work for me...and mainly because of the price tag. But, I’d be lying if I said this product doesn’t absolutely live up to the hype and then some. Yes...it does smell. It’s potent lactic acid, people- so it does have a bit of a sour milk smell (I have a very sensitive sense of smell.) But when you see the results it has for your skin...the glowiness, the more even tone, less acne, better texture...well, maybe you’ll forgive the smell like I do. I will say that I just bought a second bottle and the smell seems to be better- perhaps they slightly improved it??In either case, this stuff is the REAL DEAL. I found two times a day to be too drying and intense for my porcelain, dryish skin. But once a day at night works like a champ (and saves me money, too...)I’ve had makeup artist friends rave about how my skin looks better than ever, and they would know, having applied my makeup for years! Invest in your skin and it will thank you!",2
"I loke this product though I wouldn’t recommend to someone with dry or sensitive skin. The pads are very strong, so use if you have super oily skin. If you do have oily or blemished skin and are looking for a product that will exfoliate and even out tone, then this product is great!",1
"This is my nighttime moisturizer and oh my gosh it’s incredible. I tried to replace it because it is pricey, but nothing measured up. It feels amazing, doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and really really hydrates me. I have dry skin and this is just a must. It’s super thick which for me I love, but was a bit much for my husband who has oily skin. So keep that in mind. Also a little bit goes a super long way! My first jar lasted at least 4 months so that also helps make it worth the price in my opinion.",2
Received my complimentary sample from Influenster for my honest opinion. I love the smell and that it doesn’t leave any stickiness or residue behind. My skin absorbs it really well. Definitely will buy the full size product when I run out.,2
Amazing! My lips feel so soft and rejuvenated after using this over night! It does super well under matte lipsticks as well! I love it,2
I recieved this product in exchange for an honest review. And Honestly just not a fan. My face felt dry after using. It also turned my face red. I would not use again. i also didn’t like some of the ingredients in the product since i prefer more natural ones. overall the packaging was nice but didnt care for the product.,0
"I have super sensitive skin, this lotion can be used on the body and face! i also get really red and am sensitive to the sun. When i get a sunburn i stick this lotion in the fridge and use it when it is cold to cool down my irritated skin! I’ve gotten so many of my friends hooked on this lotion, it is THE BEST, I always try to snag this product on sale and have multiple backups!",2
Remove my makeup easily! Love it!,2
I wake up with glowing skin and smaller pores. Not a noticeable difference in fine lines. Would definitely recommend this product,1
"This works like a standard moisturizing cream; I can’t say anything in the formula stood out to me as being worth the price. I don’t have anything negative to say, since it does its job. However, if you’re on the fence, I’d go with the smallest size instead to try it out before committing.",1
Just wow. This product is amazing. It smells nice. It doesn’t leave your face super sticky. I’ve been having issues with my skin lately and I feel like my face just looks amazing once I put this on. Love it.,2
I have been using this for 3 weeks now and I can already tell a HUGE difference in my skin. It’s very moisturizing. I also see a HUGE improvement in acne scars! It brightens them because of the vitamin C!,2
"I swear by this product for completely transforming my skin! My pores look smaller, I rarely break out, and my skin texture is much smoother.",2
I’ve been using this serum for a month and really like it. It’s very light weight and it’s made my skin brighter,2
"I’m in my late 20’s with oily-combo/acne prone skin. This essence is a miracle worker and a definite MUST HAVE product if you have a similar skin type. It softens the skin so that the products that you use after it absorb better and work more effectively. I’ve been using it for about a month, and it’s definitely making a huge difference with my skin! I rarely get a new breakout now, and my skin looks plumper than it did before I started using it. I use it as the third step in my night time skincare routine; after cleansing and toning. I follow it with an acne serum, an anti-aging serum, a benzoyl peroxide lotion, and a moisturizer. Tatcha products are always worth the hype and this one is no exception! Yes, it’s pricey, but the results are 100% worth it. I’ll absolutely be re-purchasing!",2
Makes my fave feel fresh and clean! I have tried many cleansers and this one isn’t harsh on my skin. You do need a moisturizer with it if you have dry skin like mine but I use one of the moisturizers from this same brand and I love it as well!,2
Just picked this up and I love it! Has a sweet smell! Smells like soft rose petals and honey. I love it and it works great with dry sensitive skin as I have. Will be purchasing again when I run out,2
"Best cleanser I’ve ever tried!  I have super acne prone skin, and I feel like this deep-cleaned more pores more so than any other I’ve tried.  Not stripping, and foams well!  Also, this $12 bottle lasted me over a month — great value!",2
Smells great and feels like butter when you apply it but it is not moisturizing enough. It just sits on the top layer. Wouldn’t buy this again.,1
I’ve been using this cream for about 2 weeks now and I’m really liking it. My face has a glow to it and is very smooth. Most rich creams don’t absorb well but this one I find soaks right into my face without leaving any residue that’s sticky or oily. I can’t tell anything for long term results yet but I would recommend this product so far after using it for 2 weeks!,2
I love this face cleanser. After using this product to cleanse my face right away my face felt soft and clean. Also the smell of this product is amazing very fresh.,2
I don’t know why they called it “The water cream“ because I would call it “The oil cream“. Skin is too oily and it looks and feels too oily all day. Cream leaves that heavy feeling on the skin and you constantly want to wash it. I would never recommend this to a friend. Cheap cream for 3$ leaves same effect on the skin.,0
"Gave me small whiteheads all over my face and cystic acne on my cheekbone. This was my first time using AHAs and BHAs, so maybe my skin wasn’t used to this. If you’ve never used DE products before or chemical exfoliators, I’d start with something less intense. I heard pixi glow tonic is a light chemical exfoliant that gets your face used to this type of treatment. I’ll try it again to see if I get the same results, I’d hate to waste such an expensive product... I definitely would not purchase this if this is your first time trying a chemical exfoliant or drunk elephant products in general.",0
I love how this is dry and then you add water.  This makes it easier for travel.  I also love how it dissolves while using it.  This is also great for refills.  I love that this product works and has its eye on sustainability.,2
I have been using this for the last few weeks now and I can definitely see a change in my skin.  It appears brighter and younger.  I also use in the bikini area to help lesson the dark spots. So far so good.,2
Hands down changed my life. Im a huge fan of Sunday Riley. This is one of my favs. Literally see a big difference on my dark spots. I have mild breakouts & i have an oily t zone. I usually pick my face which causes blemishes. Within the very first week i saw a difference in my face.,2
I wear waterproof mascara and this removes it with a little extra effort and a washcloth. It does sting if it gets in your eyes and may cause the vision to be slightly blurry but does a great job at removing my makeup,2
This is a great spray. I did return. I didn’t like the scent. It does everything it claims. I purchased the Fresh Rose spray. Just a preference on scent.,1
I will NEVER not have this by my bed. The right side of my lower lip gets chapped and this is the only thing that will fix it over night. Best product ever.,2
Love the moisturizing effects and brightening results and 360 coverage. A little goes a long way.,2
"By far one of my favorite moisturizers for winter PM use. I have combo oily/ extremely dry skin and Lala locks in the moisture, hydrates, and absorbs very well. It does not leave me feeling greasy AND I use and argon oil with it. You also don’t have to waste product as it dispenses pump style: one pump is all you need for your face and neck. Only downside is that you cannot tell when you’re running low, however, I would not take a point off  because the product is superior to the packaging.",2
"I was hesitant when receiving this serum as I had a bad reaction to another vitamin C serum in the past, I’m glad that this one is gentle enough to not giving me any issues. I’ve been using it for almost 3 weeks now AM and PM and I have to say that I haven’t noticed much of a difference in my skin. The only thing I’ve noticed so far is a bit of less redness in my cheeks, I have dry/sensitive skin and usually have redness, it looks promising!After applying it gives me an instant glow and the appearance of healthy skin, it absorbs really quick which is great but it feels sticky at the end. It layers nicely with my face cream too.I love the packaging, is so easy to use and you can turn the cap to lock it so it’s great for me when my toddlers are checking my stuff. It has a very subtle citrusy fragrance and the consistency is more like a lightweight cream.I’ll definitely keep using it but I don’t really think I will buy it in the future.I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange of my review!",1
Eh waste of money just smells like watermelon I see no results it does give a nice glow tho not repurchasing,1
"ok so it does it’s job. that’s the first thing i want to say. it gets the makeup off. however i think my skin might not like it bc everything it gets near my eyes i cry. i just used it to take off my makeup and it left a lot of redness and i actually had to use another cleanser to wipe off the extra highlight but it got most off, but as i’m writing this my eyes r tearing!!! i like it but i definitely don’t think it’s worth $29.",1
Best night time lip treatment.,2
"I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest opinion. It helps leave my skin so soft and smooth. It removes all the dry/ dead skin and helps keeping it bright and rejuvenated. I definitely recommend this product, I love it!",2
"I received this product for free from Influenster and Estée Lauder  in exchange for my honest review. The sample product was small, so I don’t feel I can speak on the effectiveness of what this product claims to do over an extended period of time of usage. The consistency is really nice. However, I am not a fan of the scent.",1
"I have a problem with compulsively picking my lips and so they have pretty much always been cracked dry and bleeding since i was a kid. This is the only product ive ever used that was able to smooth and soften them out after a few days of use. (and i’ve tried lots of products)More expensive than I would want, so if I had normal lips probably wouldn’t be worth the money, but with my condition in mind it’s mostly worth it :) Very slight color that I like and it smells really nice which helps remind me to use it. Also it’s cute lol. I’ll probably try the other colors too",1
This balm leaves your lips super soft over night. It wears nicely under matte liquid lipsticks. They still dry down and stay all day without making lips dry and crusty.,2
"I received the tin version of this for Christmas one year and use it constantly! It’s so soft and smooth. This tube version is perfect for work and being on the go! Really helps dry lips and even dry skin around my mouth and nose. I slather this stuff on, I love it!",2
Great face wash! I got this with a 30 day kit that I got and I wanted to try a new facewash to try to get my oily skin under control. I can’t believe that I have been using the wrong cleanser for so long! It is a visible difference with my skin and as long as I moisturize and go through with my regular skin care routine I am good to go.,2
"This is not amazing but it’s also not horrible... It’s VERY rich. I like it for really cold dry Canadian winters because it truly is soothing and moisturizing but it does not absorb well. I feel it’s almost like wearing a mask where it just sits on your face for a while and does not incorporate into your skin. In the summertime I would never use this. For me, it just doesn’t breathe.",1
"When Clinique stopped selling Daily Eye Benefits, I switched to all about eyes and it works just as well, if not better. I’m very fair and my eye area tends to be dry; this product moisturizes without being greasy and gets rid of that “crepe-y“ look below my eyes.",2
This face cream is amazing! I use it nightly and it keeps my dry skin moisturized and glowy! It is light weight and doesn’t feel greasy or heavy on the skin. It absorbs quickly and I feel flawless when I wake up in the morning! This is my holy grail face cream. 10/10!,2
A great product really moisturizer my skin and felt a difference in texture.,1
My skin is very dry and I’ve gotten a lot of sun exposure this summer so this cream was not hydrating enough for me. It did help when used with their Superberry Hydrate and Glow Oil.,1
"So good! The scents are yummy and moisturizes my extremely dry lips. I use it every night before I go to sleep. The consistency is the perfect balance of doesn’t disappear immediately and soaks into your lips. Again, every scent is so good.",2
"its amazing i love it, can go out with out it",2
"I received a sample of this wrinkle correcting eye cream for my honest review. I was able to try the eye cream for 2 times (day and night). I personally enjoy using this eye cream. The texture is thick but not give me greasy feeling. It seems very hydrate. However, I m not able to tell yet is there any result to help my wrinkle.#freeproduct",1
"This is my go to lip mask. I use it daily. Even my husband loves this lip mask. We have tried the original and most recently the vanilla. Original is the best way to go, however, I am so excited they brought back the full size of the sweet candy, another fav! The mint choco was also really good but will likely have to wait for the holidays for them to bring it back again.",2
"I did not like this product at all… it really made my skin so bad, I struggle with super sensitive skin and redness and this made me even have more redness then before",0
Love this stuff ! I use it EVERYtime I do my makeup and gives me that extra UMPH* at the end,2
Super hydrating without being heavy. Perfect for what my combination dry/oily sensitive skin needed for the winter. It feels more like a gel but hydrates like a cream. And it smells subtle and lovely.,2
I used to be obsessed with nose strips because I thought that my pores were clogged and the only way to remove it was strip until I found out that was very damaging to your skin as the little bumps actually help hydrate your skin. I received complimentary from Dermalogica Sampling and started using this product and I have notice that my skin has less texture and help clear up my clogged pores without damaging. it gives me the same satisfaction of cleanliness that nose strips used to give me.  I have really enjoyed this step in my skin care routine and it’s easy application!,2
"Absolutely love this product. Felt wonderful on my skin and made me feel prepped for makeup. Wouldn’t really use it at night, I have extremely dry skin so I need something thicker, but this is perfect for a light weight moisturizer",2
"OMG I love these so much, my skin was breaking out and I thought there was no escape until I found these. I just threw them on then poof my acne GONE! These are a must have.",2
It’s a thicker moisturizer that has more of a creamy consistency. If you have dry or oily skin this won’t give you a fresh rejuvenated feeling. A little goes a long way and if you aren’t planning on giving yourself a mini massage then this product isn’t for you. Over all the hygienic packaging is great but the formula is one that should be tried in a sample first before fully committing to buying the full sized version.,1
This light non-sticky lip balm is perfect for work and play. No sticky mess like gloss but looks fantastically shiny. I use it for dry skin as well as parched lips. It is worth every penny i spent!,2
Absolutely love it! Always gets rid of my texture after oil cleansing for 30-40 min (highly recommend to YouTube the benefits of oil cleansing). it also removes all makeup so effortlessly,2
"I didn’t love this product. I was excited to try it, but I did not notice any improvement in my skin. I had no skin issues prior to using this product, but after about a month I realized I had more texture, bumps, and dry skin than when I was using my SK-II routine. I don’t reach for this product anymore, and it just sits in my skincare arsenal.",1
Not good for oily skin. I got this as a sample. I put it on once or twice and couldn’t wait to get it off my face. Maybe it’s a good product. I’m just making an opinion for others with the same skin issue.,0
"I just received the product a couple of days ago it was gifted to me by Dermalogica.  i didn’t have time to try it enough but I can say that so far so good, although the powder can be messy, i would suggest doing it directly in the shower or bath.",1
"I had high hopes of this cream after reading all the positive reviews. I’ve used this for a month now and I can confidently say this product is it not for me. This cream is heavy in application and does not absorb easily into the skin. After an hour of apply it, my skin felt tacky and not sufficiently moisturized.",0
"Not impressed, never felt like it sufficiently cleansed my skin",1
"I have oily skin, and I was needing something a little more moisturizing than the DE Protini moisturizer for the colder weather. I love how it is thick but it doesn’t feel too heavy on my skin. If you have very dry skin, this moisturizer may not be moisturizing enough for you. However, it makes a perfect winter moisturizer for my oily skin!",2
Love it. I got it as a sample and plan to buy it next time I shop at Sephora. It made my skin feel so soft and refreshed. Love that it has essential oils in it. Also love the frothy texture.,2
"I added The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Serum to my beauty regimen. This hydrates my face immediately, and keeps my skin so soft. I really liked it. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting softer skin.",1
"This actually didn’t help remove any makeup for me and my mascara wasn’t even water proof. It left my skin soft, but that’s about it. There are much better oil cleansers out there for a better price.",0
"I use this gel lightly all over after exfoliating first with either the Sephora pore scrubbing pad or my Clarisonic, with a little more focus on my problem areas (for me that’s dry patches on my cheeks and the bridge of my nose). It works better than anything I’ve ever used to exfoliate those key areas.The gel, which balls up/pills on the skin, does do that to a certain extent on any skin you apply it to. It reacts with the skin and the product itself balls up. However, it takes a decent amount of dead skin with it -- something I’ve tested by using this gel on regular skin and on skin that I’ve lightly exfoliated using the Sephora pore scrubbing pad. On skin that’s already been lightly exfoliated, the product balls up significantly less, suggesting that a decent amount of the product that balls up *is* dead skin.As I said, I use this product after I gently exfoliate with another method, and I would highly recommend others use it the same way because it makes the bottle last longer because you don’t need as much product. It really smooths the areas that other exfoliators just can’t -- for the first time in my life, I’m able to wear foundation on my nose in the winter without it flaking off in patches.",2
Ok ladies I rarely write reviews unless I feel the product is review worthy and this one fits into this category. You will love this product and your lips will love it even more in the morning. Lipstick goes on ever so smoothly and stays on even with mask wearing. My 69 year old lips just drink this up. Definitely 5 stars,2
This facial cleanser works wonders. It leaves my skin feeling very refreshed and extremely moisturized. I absolutely love this face wash and it leaves my skin feeling extremely soft after I use it.,2
"I’ve always had dry skin, but no other skin issues... until I turned 25 and suddenly started getting these tiny bumps around my eyes and forehead, along with some jawline breakouts. I have a very good skin care routine and use high quality makeup, but after trying lots of different products I thought I would have to just live with small bumps on my face. This product started clearing up the bumps and the breakout spots after just one use— and I continue to use it twice a week for maintainence. I would recommend using a good moisturizer the next day though to balance it all out— I use Honeymoon Glow one night and then the All-in-one Farmacy serum as a night mask the following day. Skins never looked better!",2
I like this product. I have a lot of redness on my face and it did help with soothing my skin. I also liked how quickly it absorbed into my skin and it left my skin feeling hydrated.,1
"I’ve been very iffy about this product for a while now.I bought it once and returned it because I saw no difference and I hated the smell. But after reading several great reviews about it I decided to give it a second chance. After months and months, I repurchased it and used it as soon as I got home. I felt a couple large pimples coming in and I dapped some on the pimple and the next day it reduced it’s size. It doesn’t complete eliminate the pimples, but it does reduce the size in just one night before bed.",1
My skin feels softer than a babies bottom with this! I love how fast it absorbs into my pores. It gives you that nice at the spa feeling and helps tone out uneven skin.,1
"My skin absorbed it nicely and left my skin hydrated, i hope it works as anti-aging, i used a sample so i cannot judge it any further",2
"I have and always will battle with redness. My heritage is Irish, and my skin is always red. This product is shockingly good. I rarely write reviews, but the moment I put it on my face my reaction was “holy s**t!“. Not only did it even out my skin tone, it also moisturized the dry patches on my chin and made my skin feel amazing. All I ever wanted was to be the girl that can wake up, wash her face, throw on a cream, and go feeling confident that her complexion looks great. This product finally gave me that (and believe me, I’ve tried everything)! I will be a buyer for life.",2
Light and fast absorbing with a nice fresh scent. Does not make my skin too oily or too dry no matter what cleanser I’m using. On my second jar using it as my day moisturizer.,2
"I’ve been using retin-a for a month or two to try to keep my skin clear/help prevent aging (I’m 22). My skin has been peeling like CRAZY and nothing has been able to help. You’re supposed to stick with retin-a past the gnarly peely/red months in order to get amazing skin, but I’ve been thinking about stopping because I can’t stand how flaky it’s been. I got this in the mail yesterday, and it is insane how much it has helped my skin already. It looks and feels dewy!! Now I can stick with the retin-a until my skin gets used to it.",2
Obsessed with this product!! Leaves a light coverage but overall mostly a glow. I wear it on its own or under makeup & still feel protected from the sun. Never clogs my pores too which is KEY for me!,1
"I love this product! I received a sample in a Birchbox and fell in love with it. I quickly decided to purchase the full size during customer appreciation week. I love the smell of it and it feels so nice on the skin, it has improved the tone and texture of my skin dramatically! I use it at night follwed by Dr. Jart  Ultimate Hydro Gel and I wake up with glowing skin! My only complaint is that my stopper doesn’t work very well and for the price of this product, that shouldn’t happen, but I can deal with it! If you’re contemplating this product, you should definitely give it a go, you won’t be sorry!",2
"It doesn’t happen overnight, but over time, this will change your skin. I am on probably my sixth bottle over a couple years. It keeps pores clearer and eradicates acne scars. I will never be without it.",2
This eye cream/gel does the job. Its not a usual eye cream that gets rid of undereyes or dark circles really but it helps SO MUCH with moisture. It does not lie about that. I love the cool feeling it has once you put on! I recommend if your undereyes crease a lot when you put makeup.,2
I need to start out by saying I CANNOT wait to use this in the summer since it give me such a beautiful shine. The best way I can describe the consistency is smooth but slippery. It glides right onto your face but it has a slip to it. Once fully absorbed you’re left with a beautiful finish and can’t feel it on the skin. I have had no issues with it clogging pores or cause me to breakout. I do wear sunscreen everyday and this has started becoming my daily sunscreen.,2
"I really like using this for everyday wear with other DE products.  It feels nice, not sticky, not too heavy, nice little bit of color.  Last a pretty long time even with daily use.",1
I tried the small deluxe size and I fell in love so I brought the $25 medium size one! Will definitely repurchase!!!,2
Let me start off by saying that I have extremely sensitive skin and a very pale complexion and I can’t really use spray sunscreen. I saw this product online last year and knew that I had to try it. I definitely don’t regret that! This product is now one of my favorites and makes putting on sunscreen much more enjoyable as this one doesn’t leave a white residue or ANY residue for that matter. It also doesn’t burn my skin and it feels super natural and not oily at all! I do understand that it is a bit pricey but it is 100% worth it in my book!,2
It’s the perfect amount of product for the price. This feels super luxury and has corresponding packaging. It was super gentle on my skin and left my skin feeling super refreshed after one use! I love it. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,2
"I’m in the middle of changing my skincare to Tatcha just because I’ve heard so many good things about the line. I figured that since this product has so many good reviews that I would give it a shot. Not sure if it’s my skin or what, but I don’t see much of a difference and I actually started noticing breakouts and dryness after using this. Maybe my skin is sensitive to it. I’m going to give it another shot by using it only once every other day and see how it goes. If it breaks me out again, I’ll just have to return it and say it’s a no go for me. But anyway, just be careful using it if you’re seem to have sensitive skin!",1
I really wanted to love this sunscreen since I had read such great reviews online but it just didn’t work for me. The texture is non greasy  and works well under makeup. But just after a few uses and I can see that it has darkened my dark spots. Going back to physical sunscreens. I would not recommend it to people suffering from hyperpigmentation.,1
"Love the glow recipe avocado recovery serum. Right away, I could tell that it was soothing my skin. Felt super moisturizing and revitalizing! Definitely worth trying if you’ve been on the fence. Worth the purchase!",2
"I feel neutral about this product. I received a free sample to try, and have been using it before I put my moisturizer and other products on. It soaks in to my skin very well, and I don’t notice it once I have put it on. The downside is that I don’t really notice a change in my skin, so I am not sure that I will continue to use it.",1
I love it! It’s good for S. Cali weather,2
"This product has done wonders for my skin!!! I have been using this product for months! I get small hormonal acne breakouts around my period, and this product has helped keep those breakouts very minimal/at bay. It has improved the overall texture of my skin, it is no longer bumpy and no random dry spots around my skin; in other words, it has truly balanced my skin. I have also noticed my skin is less oily in the t-zone and slightly minimized pores. This is really the ONLY [treatment] skincare product I use! (I apply moisturizer & SPF after using this in the AM, and PM use this alone after washing my face.) A little goes a long way, don’t apply too much or you’ll be sticky. I highly recommend this product to any skin type or concern. Using this has encouraged me to NOT pick my skin, otherwise, if you have broken skin while using this product it will STING! Do not pick your skin, PERIODT!",2
"I tried this after I got a free sample and I’m definately buying some ASAP! My skin just drinks it up. I have used this less than a week but my skin feels AMAZING. No breakouts and so so so SOFT. Not the prettiest container but the results are clear, beautiful, baby-soft skin!",2
"This cleansing oil has become my #1 favorite cleanser. After trying or temporarily going back to other face cleansers, I end up going back to this one. I have normal skin, but more dry as winter comes on, and the texture and ingredients of this are absolutely perfect for cleansing without stripping my skin’s natural moisture. It smells fantastic, too, so using this is a truly pleasurable experience all around. When using it at night to remove my makeup, I use a bit just on my eyes to gently get the makeup off and then tissue it off before putting more on to cleanse my face. It easily and gently washes off with water. LOVE this! Highly recommend-- while it’s definitely pricey, only a bit is needed so a bottle should last quite awhile.",2
"This product really intrigued me so I had to try it out. The dots stick on and don’t come off which is awesome and they do not smell like chemicals. I put one on overnight, with a whitehead pimple, and it definitely shrunk in size. It didn’t completely go away but this product really helped if you’re looking for a quick way to reduce inflammation. I will be continuing to use these!! I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review.",1
"I love the smell and look of this lip mask, but it does not stay on as long as I expected. I wake up in the morning with soft lips, but they no longer have the mask on.",1
"I’ve only been using for a week but this stuff is amazing. Great for winter weather, super thick!",2
"The lightest deep moisturizer I could hope for, by far. With my combination break-out prone skin this cream is heaven. Aside from the wonderful scent & beautiful container, the moisturizer took care of my skin during the humid summer & dry winter in Chicago this past year. Super silky, no greasy residue. Feels like a treat every time I apply it, yet my skin breaths. Quite pricey, and not a lot of it, yet so worth it. I am done spending tons of money on other creams. Love the little tiny container too, which comes with some of the sets; I keep re-filling it for my purse on the go. Tried the lighter version (white) for the most humid summer months, and was super impressed as well. SO DONE WITH OTHER CREAMS.",2
"just the best!it’s shiny, not goopy, moisturizing, and the pot is big, there’s enough room to smoosh your finger pad and not worrry about product under your nail.it has a light scent from the roses, but you barely notice it - it doesnt compete with perfume.it’s light for a metal tin, and the lid has never accidentally popped off in my bag, and I’ve had about 4 tins - each lasts about a year for me too.for what it’s worth the package and the product can withstand being washed (and dried) too - no need to worry about melted goop on your clothes, and an empty tin.I use it everywhere - lips, knees, elbows, after waxing/tweezing, to tame brows/flyaways (doesnt get stiff, or melt off onto my eyeshadow like vaseline), on scrapes, but my fave is on my cuticles, it doesnt leave them greasy or stinky and I can smear any left overs on my lips!",2
This is such a lovely cleanser! Wonderfully balanced and perfect for my tempermental skin. I started going “Clean at Sephora“ and what a difference that has made! This cleanser has a safe ph for the face (the face is usually about a 5.5 ph). There is not a lot of foaming with this product but it cleans my face very well.  I use an oil cleanser to take off my makeup and then use this. It’s not as effective with taking off makeup on its own. The only problem I have with this item is that I dropped it a foot from the ground and the cap broke. I was so mad but I still love this cleanser.,2
This is very hard to get out! Product is too thick and the oils seem so separate. Takes off some make up definitely not all. As with any greasy cleanser you cant use it on your eyes or the oils will get in you eye. It is very moisturizing and may work for a double cleanse routine.,0
A little goes a long way. Feels great on your skin and doesn’t rub off like some overnight masks do. Skin looks noticeable softer and hydrated in the morning.,2
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! My skin is very sensitive and it’s been great. It’s very light, doesn’t clog pores and smells amazing.I got it complimentary for testing purposes and so glad I did. Lancome skin care products are some of my favorite.",2
"I’ve been using this serum in the mornings for a few months now, followed by hyaluronic acid or a moisturizer, and retinol at night. Not sure if it’s the product alone or the combination of the above, but my oily skin is clearer and more even than in ages. So happy I tried it!",2
"Smells great, and applies like a moisturizer. I can’t say my makeup last longer with this I kinda feel as if it wears off kinda quick. I’m actually very dry and I feel like this makes me look oily through the the day, which isn’t a good thing. Makes me want to take my makeup off. I’m not sure if it’s this or something else. I’ll keep trying it to be sure. But I like the idea of this product. So hopefully it isn’t.",1
"makes skin SO soft! absolutely love, so moisturizing as well. Perfect base.",2
I love this! Removes makeup so easily and makes your skin feel very soft and moisturized while still feeling clean and not greasy.,2
"This cleanser cleans pretty well but really doesn’t do anything for my oily, acne prone skin. Doesn’t perform better or worse than any other run of the mill cleanser.",1
"I got it as a sample and then I had to buy a full size. It looks nice, smells nice, and works. I noticed a difference in how soft my face felt and my pores looked smaller. I am very happy with this product.",2
"I’ve been using the moisturizer eye bomb during the day and night routine. This product helped me to keep my eyes hydrated, during the dry-cold season. I can apply my makeup without a problem. I can say that I’ve notice that my eye expression marks have diminished a little bit. I got this product as a sample for review purposes, and now is one of my must have products!",2
Muy buen producto y precio razonable Me gusta mucho,1
"I can’t live without this product. It works wonders on zits. I’ve also used it on skin rashes (allergies, cold sores...) and it helps.",2
"Seriously love this stuff. I use it every morning & night and have never had such an even skin tone. It brightened up my dark spots in just a few weeks of use. People are always asking me how my skin is so dewy and smooth, well this stuff is the answer.Please never discontinue it!",2
"I bought this since it got so many great reviews.. I was really excited to try it out, but I was kind of disappointed. This is a very very gentle wash, so if that is what you like, this is for you. I personally don’t like super gentle washes because I don’t really feel like its cleansing my face, so I decided to try the philosophy purity foam wash instead, which I like better. This wash def feels fresh though",0
"If you want to dry out your skin, this is a great way to do it.  I found it extremely drying and started using it as hand soap just to use it up... (you get a lot for your money) and ended up with dry hands.  It’s a hard pass on this one. I also prefer a pump or easier dispenser",0
"I do love this as a nightly mask. I find that my skin feels hydrated and refreshed. Do I feel that for the price point it is absolutely worth it? No. But if you’re able to splurge, I do recommend this. It’s great for dry and combination skin, doesn’t feel greasy, or sticky either. I typically wear it all night long and then wash it off in the morning and do my regular routine.",1
"I got a deluxe sample of this and will be buying the full size. I feel like I went through it fast, but I probably used more than I needed but it just makes my face feel so good after. I love it, I feel smooth and hydrated almost like I don’t even need to moisturize afterwards.  Where as most makeup removers I’ve used, leave me feeling dry and tight.  And the smell is so awesome, a very light smell of like sorbet.  5 stars for me!",2
"I’ve been using this for many years. I use it on my under eyes at night for extra hydration. It works so well for me. This is great for cuticles or dry patches on your face or body. I don’t really use it as a lip balm , though. I could use it in a pinch but I have better lip balms. As for eye cream, it works better than all the expensive eye creams I’ve tried in the past. I’m sticking with this for $7",2
"Gentle. Doesn’t dry out my face, yet provides a fresh, clean rinse.",2
"Just opening the package for the first time,, this product really feels like a luxury product.  Although I’m not a fan of jars where I’ll have to dip my fingers to use the product, I really like that this has a replaceable component to the seemingly oversized jar/holder. The formula itself has a lovely smooth texture, and a little goes a looooong way. I used this as a primer for foundation, and it went on rather smoothly. However I don’t think I’d use it again. I have combo/oily skin, and it definitely affected the wearability of the foundation and by extension the feel of my skin. Being that hyaluronic acid is one of the main ingredients, this is highly moisturizing-- I think it might be a better application as a night pack.",1
"I received this product complimentary from dermalogica in exchange for my honest feedback. After using this product, my skin looks smooth and hydrated. This has helped my dull skin look brighter. I use this daily with my other skin care routine products. Great exfoliating product that removes dirt and cleans clogged pores.",1
Love this sunscreen. I was worried it would be too greasy but it melts into my skin well.,2
"I use this moisturizer every morning. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smells amazing. I have an oily t-zone and dry cheeks and when combined with the zero oil toner, it keeps my t zone under control and everything hydrated.",2
in love with this product the only thing I’m unhappy with is myself because I’m kicking myself in the butt for not taking a before picture.i read reviews on here and h someone said it helped with pesky acne cluster that they had forever that wouldn’t go away on the chin . I used the sample from Sephora and wow they were right my forehead is almost clear .one more night and I’m sure it will be good. definitely adding into my skincare route.,2
Very light and smooth eye cream.  I use it in the morning and have had no problems with burning or sensitivity.  See a decrease in puffiness too.  Works as well as much more expensive eye creams!,2
"I’m devastated. This was my only non-negotiable daily product. Then they changed it. I love(d) it so much, I’m gonna stick around and see what happens, but this mix-yourself version I may have to return. I appreciate the sentiment, the desire to deliver a fresh product, but the whole contraption doesn’t really work well. Awaiting the next version....",1
My skin feels so clean and smooth after using this. My skin feels ready after washing and ready for my serums and moisturizer,2
I’m 42 years old and have been on a pursuit to find a eye cream that works. I can finally say I have found it! I can feel it working immediately after application and keeps my skin hydrated to. Doesn’t take very much so this bottle should last. Good job Shiseido!,2
"This is an absolute must have if you have skin on the dryer side! I have combination skin, with oily T-zones, but very very dry cheeks/nose areas. This cream makes my skin feel so much softer and it actually WORKS the 24-hours that it boasts. Even after I wash my face, my skin continues to feel hydrated, which I am surprised by! This moisturizer might become my new staple go-to cream, because of that. I’m also glad it doesn’t have much of a fragrance at all.",2
This is my favorite sunscreen.  I always kind of hated sunscreen as the various types I used were hard to put on evenly.  This stuff glides right on.  I love it.,2
"I purchased this for myself-however, my daughter (13) is using this as well! I have dry to normal skin and my daughter has dry to oily skin. It works on both of us beautifully. I use several Josie Maran products and love them all!",2
"Love love love this product ! Love how there’s a spatula with the product for hygienic purpose; love the lime scent; love the overall performance . Definitely would recommend this product, especially over other brands version of a cleansing balm.",2
I get a lot of uneven texture on my forehead and perimeter of my face. The retinol oil is really nice. I notice if I use it consistently my skin is soft and smooth with out the dry flaky skin tradition retinols give me. My skin is too sensitive for the good genes but it’s a great product. Light weight enough under make up and smells like citrus.,1
"This is the perfect pick-me-up for airline weary, road trip weary, new mom weary, gardening/much sun weary faces. It’s my favorite facial spray. Unobtrusively moisturizing too. Muss and fuss free.",2
"Dermalogica daily microfoliant was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling.The first time I was introduced to Dermalogica was at a facial. I could see an immediate difference in my skin. This lead to at-home use of the Daily microfoliant. This product does what it promises! It’s a fine, rice-based exfoliant powder that gently smooths and brightens your skin — and a little goes a long way. This is on my personal “best of” list. Would highly recommend.",2
"I received a sample of this in an It Kit last year, and fell in love immediately. This is the only skin cleanser that I’ve used that doesn’t dry out my face entirely. I still use a moisturizer after washing my face with it, but every other face cleanser I have used has left my face dry, flaky, and painfully taut with daily use. Murad is different. Love it.",2
"i use these all the time for stubborn pimples. holy grail product. a little hard to keep stuck in some areas but i blame my face bones for that, not the patches. (apply on a clean bare face before all other skincare or they won’t stay put!)",2
"I don’t say this lightly- this eye cream is freaking fantastic. I definitely would recommend this product if you’re struggling to find a solution for stubborn under eye circles.  I have terrible dark circles under my eyes caused by thin skin and allergies (mostly, although i’m sure more sleep couldn’t hurt...) I’ve tried so many eye creams to help brighten and plump my skin and none of them have had any visible results until C-Tango. I received this product as a sample via an online order. I’ve been using this for a week now every morning and evening, and I can honestly say that my under eye circles have been slowly fading! Usually I need foundation and like 3 layers of concealer to even remotely hide those suckers, but this stuff is truly helping a lot. I have sensitive skin, and although other reviews say this is not for sensitive skin, I have not had any issues with this product at all. It’s a creamy texture that absorbs quickly, and leaves no residue so you can layer makeup easily over it or wear it to bed. A little goes a long way too, so even though this is a bit pricey, this should last you quite a while. I will absolutely be purchasing this full size once I run out of the trial- give it a try!",2
I’ve had this product for 5 days and absolutely love it! I get random acne spots on my face and redness. I noticed within the first 3 days that my acne AND acne scars are lessened. My face is smoother and less red!,2
"Drunk Elephant gifted me their C-Firma Fresh Day Serum. While having a premixed formula is more convenient, I do understand that having to mix this myself means I am getting a better potency, which is important when it comes to vitamin c products. The directions are easy to follow and it doesn’t take much effort to get this put together. It is important to shake for at least a full minute to make sure the powder is fully mixed in. The scent isn’t the best, and from what I understand, the 15% L-Ascorbic Acid is what causes the product to feel sticky on skin. If you can get past those things, then this has helped with some dark spots I have from acne. So my complexion is looking more even after using.",1
This product doesn’t do anything. Bought it and immediately returned it. Save your time & money!,0
"Not as hydrating as I had hoped. I tried this instead of the Belif sleep mask, looking for something at a lower price point. Unfortunately, this is not worth the price. Besides not being as hydrating as it claims to be, it has a strange smell that is not calming. It smells like a creamsicle   dove bar soap.",0
I can’t understand the bad reviews that this product is getting. I have literally tried almost every product out there and I can tell u I have never seen anything work like this. I received this as a tester in my beauty box and one application I pat this into my skin and this instantly works.,2
"I got this product for free from SK-II & I’ve been using this product about a month in the hot dry Colorado climate. The first day that I tried it I got big red panda eyes after I put it on with a cotton bud. I decided to wait 3 days and try again, splashing it on with my hands instead of wiping it on. What a different! My skin feels plump & my open pores less visible. I have a large scar on below my lip that is also less obvious. It is a great base for make up . The bottle should last a long time if you splash it on twice a day. 46 year old skin without makeup & the scar required 25 external stitches plus internal stitches.",2
"I’ve been testing out the Sunday Riley 5 Stars Retinol + Niacinamide Eye Cream for about two weeks and I can say I know why it is called 5 stars!! This has such an awesome creamy yet rich texture. It feels so nice upon application. The product doesn’t leave any discoloration or residue behind. It’s very easy to apply with the tip being so convenient. I love the ingredients, this is such a great brand and I’ve never tried a product I haven’t liked! I use this everyday so I am happy there’s no irritation it’s definitely safe to use daily! I have found my new go to eye cream. This beauty leaves your under eyes so smooth, hydrated, and I also noticed brightening! I haven’t noticed anything for wrinkles I have a tiny fine line but it’s not very noticeable however I did notice some plumping in that area where it wasn’t as noticeable to me, which is a plus. If your on the fence about this product or have sensitive skin I personally have somewhat sensitive skin and like I said I had no problem. I think this is definitely worth a try and I would recommend to others for sure! Oh and the packaging is also super cute, which just adds a plus in my book!",2
"Evens out my skin. Will buy again. Not as thick a coverup as a foundation or CC creme, but I can still leave the house with just this on top of moisturizer.",1
Left my skin with a sticky uncomfortable feeling - very weird sensation,0
I bought this last night and used it before bed. This is a fantastic product. The redness is almost gone. The difference is dramatic. I’m in my early 30s and tend to breakout due to stress. I think this product is going to be a game changer for me.,2
"I am loving this product. I use vitamin C drops every morning, but am placing that on pause while I try out this product. So far loving it. The texture is amazing and makes me feel refreshed every morning. Ingredients look great. Packaging is super user friendly as well. My skin absorbs the product well. Think i would maybe add this as a every other day product and use my more concentrated drops the other days.",2
This is the best!!! Second time buying this product because I went through it so quickly the first time! I put it on every night before bed and my lips stay hydrated the entire next day!! I never get chapped lips anymore!! The best!,2
"Unlike some other reviewers, I have not had a problem with this being comedogenic or irritating my skin (and I have sensitive skin). However, the amount of fragrance in it is overdone and unnecessary. There’s better turmeric (potent antioxidant) serums out there for less.",1
"I am an Esthetician and I am always looking for new products, I was in Sephora and saw this products tester and tried it out on the back of my hand and it blew me away I had to buy. After my first time using it on my face my skin glowed for days. Love!",2
I love this moisturizer!! I have very dry skin and this is a miracle worker! Its a thick cream so if you aren’t into thicker creams than this one might not be for you. I noticed all my fine lines look a lot plumper. The crow’s feet around my eyes also are plumped. My skin is no longer dry due to this moisturizer I can see this being great during the winter. I even put this on my hands. And it works amazing. It’s not greasy and my skin just drinks it up!,2
"truly the best cleansing balm i’ve ever used, i’ve tried a lot and phew i always go back to this one. it’s the only one that doesn’t leave a film on my face with clean ingredients. i’m acne prone, went through accutane, tret, everything and this is the only one that doesn’t break me out. love it so much plus it lasts awhile❤️❤️❤️",2
"I received samples of this product from Pinch Me for my honest review.  I’ve used these a couple years ago and not sure why I stopped.  But after getting a chance to try these again, I realize how much I loved them and miss their simplicity and effectiveness.  These are gentle enough for daily use, yet extremely effective in yielding noticeable results of a smoother brighter and more even skin texture.  And because there’s nothing to rinse off, you don’t need to commit time to a bathroom and hover over a sink.  You get awesome results just from a couple minutes of use while relaxing watching tv or laying down in bed.  That works for me.",2
"Love this Squalene Rose oil! My skin was definitely lacking vitamin c because I can tell a totally difference in the brightness of my skin since using this oil. My skin is more radiant! I have oily, semi acne prone skin and this product has not made me breakout. I use it every night and most mornings",2
"What I love most about this product is its versatility...I can skip packing a mini hand lotion and lipgloss...I use this as both and its gentle enough to use around my newborn baby! Plus, it’s not so shiny that my husband doesn’t mind using it either!",2
"I have purchased this product 4x over. The balm is made with pressed oils and it removes my makeup well. In the past, I used wipes but this does the job better. I have combo oily skin and was afraid that the balm would clog my pores but using this for years, I have not had any problems. This will not completely remove all specks of makeup (in my opinion) so I always follow up my Clarisonic/Purity combo. I don’t travel with this for the fear of it melting in my bag but this item is a staple for years to come.",2
I love glow recipe products. I love the fact you can use very little and get moisture all day. It’s light and just smooths the skin m. Feels like water. Will keep in my skin care routine for life.,2
"i’ve noticed a dramatic change in my skins evenness, tone and moisture. forsure becoming a staple in my skin care forever, the product is long lasting so ur 100% getting your moneys worth",2
"I took the time to try this product to be able to say that it became my favorite, it deeply hydrates the skin, gives it a lovely shine and luminosity, it has a fairly faint smell which in my opinion makes it even better, in my case I apply it Before makeup and this, although it hydrates the skin, leaves it a beautiful appearance, it does not leave the skin greasy, the truth is, thank you very much Influenster and Guerlain for letting me try your product and thus get my new favorite product",2
I like this one better than the aquabomb. It hydrates much better.,2
My skin is severely dry and flaky after using these pads for a few days. I like that my skin was not initially irritated upon contact but the effects of the pads are awful.,0
"I LOVE this serum! I’ve only used it for the past 2 weeks and I can see a big difference in my skin. I have less bumps, and my skin is looks clean and radiant. Definitely repurchasing it again.",2
I have used this moisturizer for 30 years.  Lived in ultra dry climates and very humid climates.  Nothing does the job as well as this lotion.,2
This cleanser works like magic on sensitive skin! I have never used a cleanser that made an actual difference. Be sure to follow the 60 second rule and give this wash enough time to actually work into the skin so you are reaping ALL benefits of this amazing cleanser!!!,2
I like this Lip Balm because it is special for dry lips and also it is really good for moisturizing  and hydratation on the lips. It smells really good like fruit punch or like bubblegum. It has a very soft and light pink color and it leaves a nice tin. This lip balm is glossing and creamy.  #freesample #trywithtopbox,1
"I’m beyond disappointed in this sunscreen. It smells like seafood, like really bad. I really don’t tend to leave bad comments but this sunscreen was definitely not worth it. Save your money and buy EltaMD sunscreen. This one was so tiny I couldn’t believe it was $30.",0
"Seldom do I write a review. I’ll be leaving this same review on all 4 if The Ordinary that I use consistently; Hyaluronic Acid, Retinoids, Salicylic Acid, & Lactic Acid. Before using The Ordinary I had a list of issues with my skin; intense dry patches, small bumps, scarring, intense painful acne that just would not go away. I tried many paths, products and treatments to improve my skin and comfort and unfortunately nothing seemed to help.After about 1.5 months of continuous use of the ordinary my skin started to slowly change. The Ordinary products are wonderful, simple, no added unnecessary fillers/scents, ethical, and my favourite company. One of the only company’s I’ve remained loyal to because I respect their products and what they stand for. The Ordinary isn’t an end all be all, or a quick fix! Please take care of yourself. I’ve also worked on a lot of life issues, try to keep my stress low, take better care of myself and not overwhelm myself when I am able. I will say that in addition to all of this I don’t believe the drastic and intense changes in my skin are massive and I don’t believe they would’ve been possible without this brand. I’ve shared The Ordinary with friends, family, and clients. It’s affordable, simple, and wonderful. PHOTOS above are before I used the ordinary and after 7.5 consistent months of use. It’s taken me time and research to find which products are most beneficial to me! ☺️ There’s so much helpful info and videos from dermatologists on this brand and how to use these products, also suggestions on which will be best. Everyone I’ve introduced it to adores their products, I’ve never received so many compliments on my skin. (I’m my second photo I am only wearing a couple dots of concealer. (My scars texture is unreal)How ever, everyone’s skin is different.Just keep that in mind. ❤️",2
"So this is my first time buying anything from this brand. Let me just say I can see a difference in my pores. I have very enlarged pores on my nose and after 10 minutes of using this mask, I immediately saw a difference! I’m definitely going to be buying more from this brand!",2
"I’ve made 4 of my friends buy this face mask. This just shows how much I love it. Not only my pimple disappears, it also brightens up my face. I love the ’earthy’ smell of it knowing there’s not much chemicals in it.",2
"Just do yourself a favor and try this product. You will notice a difference. I use twice a week, in the evening. I deal with dry, sensitive skin and this does make my face turn red but it fades. I have a clearer complexion after a couple of weeks and paired with DE’s The Littles, I’ve noticed a tremendous difference in the overall feel and appearance of my skin. I never would have tried the Babyfacial had I not received it as a birthday gift, now I’m definitely going to keep this stocked at all times.  Little tip: if you have aggravated your skin in any way (a scratch, a popped zit, etc), expect to experience a less than pleasant sensation after application. Some call it tingling, I call it a BURN. Thankfully that only lasts for a few seconds and it does stop almost immediately.",2
"Perfect lip balm for winter time! Great moisturizing formula and pleasant scent (not overpowering)! You get more product in this than Maybelline baby lips. I took a picture of the product twisted all the way out. It may look short, but the diameter is very wide. I think for better application they could diminish the diameter and make it longer length wise.",2
"I’ve been using this product for a few months already, and oh my god what an excellent product. I feel my lips so soft the next day. I don’t have to focus on my chapped lips every few hours when I wear my matte lipsticks. Will buy again when I finish!",2
"I received a free sample of the Moisture Surge 100H Auto-Replenishing Hydrator Moisturizer from Influenster and absolutely loved it for my dry skin. It is a gel formula and goes on smoothly. It absorbed quickly into my skin and did not cause any irritation with the few uses in the tube I was provided. It is not scented either which is important to me in a moisturizer. Not only did this give my skin a natural glow on its own, but it worked well under all my other skincare and did not pill or cause any weird interactions with my other products or foundation. I found this moisturizer kept my makeup looking better throughout the day by keeping my skin hydrated. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this moisturizer to any fellow dry skin sufferers. I’d definitely invest in a full size!",2
I really love the bronze glow from these drops. It’s a subtle but noticeable shade and really pretty,2
"I received this product just a couple days ago and it has already made it on my must have list! Working long shifts in gloves, my skin tends to be more on the dry and irritated side. Before applying this product my hands were extremely red, dry, and painful. After applying this product, my hands instantly calmed down and the redness started to subside. The texture is more of a whipped gel that seems to cool and soothe as it is rubbed into your skin, something I have yet to find with any other moisturizer. It has been 3 days of consistent use on my hands and face and I already feel like I cannot go a day without this miracle moisturizer! The Greek yoghurt seems to truly nourish my skin for hours and hours on end after just one application, I am more than happy to say it has become a staple in my beauty routine and I truly believe if you try it you will also fall in love with Korres!",2
"A very weirdly-textured oil. Has almost the same feel of an essential or dry oil, in that it really doesn’t glide over the skin nicely or absorb very well. I was using this nightly for several weeks and found it made my skin quite soft, but exacerbated the redness and texture on my face. As soon as I stopped using, my skin improved greatly. I have seborrhoeic dermatitis and I was hoping the presence of linoleic acid in this oil would help balance and hydrate my skin, but it unfortunately left me red, bumpy and flaky. Would not recommend for those with inflammatory issues on their face.",0
"seriously so amazing for those with dry skin, especially during the wintertime. i normally don’t leave reviews for anything but this is worth the purchase lol",2
"didnt like it, did nothing for my wrinkkles, but the scent was nice",0
"This was gifted by Dermalogica SamplingI really like this product because is different t from the rest, I could see a different after using it a couple times. I would 100% recommend using this, you would not regret",2
"It’s a great moisturizer for dry skin and worked great during the winter and wasn’t too heavy for the summer! If you have money to blow then this can satisfy your needs to spend and dry skin! But if you’d rather not pay the price, there are other cheaper alternatives that do the exact same thing!",1
been using this moisturizer for two weeks now and absolutely love it. My skin is glowing and Ive had no reaction whatsoever. I have a ton of allergies so its hard to find a good lotion. My only complaint is that it takes a bit to dry so I had to slightly change my skin care routine.,2
"So I have to admit I was not in love with this product at first, but because I could not turn down Hyaluronic acid for such an amazing price (after research of course) I even bought a second bottle, still not totally convinced. My main issue was the tacky feeling and the pilling. I then read that it needed to be applied to a wet face. I began using it after spraying with my facial spray and it was mildly better. Then I discovered the life changing combo: mixing it with Dr. Dennis Gross’s Hyraluronic Marine Booster. When mixed with that, and put on wet skin, it is the most amazing thing I have ever put on my skin. I have it four instead of three, because this combination is so fantastic, but a four instead of a five, because using this product in this way makes it infinitely more costly. I will use the Marine Booster no matter what the cost so if this makes it even better, I will continue to use this as part of my powerhouse combination!",1
This made all my pores MASSIVE the next day. Dissapointed,0
I’ve always used a toner after removing makeup and cleansing. This one is so mild and hydrating that I’m hooked and can’t live without it despite the price tag.,2
I just got through my first jumbo sized bottle of this stuff which lasted 7 months (I use only before I apply my make up daily) I have combo skin but no matter what oil free product I used my make up always got greasy looking within a few hrs. With this I noticed a HUGE improvment on the oil and shine and my face is never dry even through winter.,2
"I really wanted to like this toner but I just don’t think it’s the right fit for my skin. I used it for about a month but I was noticing more blemishes than normal so I switched back to the toner I’ve been using for like 5 years which is the Clinique clarifying lotion in 1.0, after only a few days my skin was back to normal. I noticed that the Clinique toner removed more of what my face washed missed I could see a very noticeable difference in what was on the cotton ball the cotton balls that I used with the Glow Recipe Watermelon Glow Toner never had any discoloration to them. With Clinique however the cotton balls were discolored and had traces of missed make-up, dead skin cells, and dirt/impurities. This explained why I was noticing more blemishes than usual while I was using the Glow Recipe watermelon glow toner. The watermelon toner wasn’t cleaning my skin as well and was most liking leaving behind dirt and impurities in my pores which was causing my skin to produce blemishes.",0
Bomb! Soooo soft on your skin. Worth every penny.,2
"As someone who is super pale I absolute love self tanning products, especially ones that are easy to use and this one is one of my favorites! I mainly use these on my face and love that they are mess free, easy to use, and don’t transfer onto clothing! They do have a slight scent to it, but it’s not overpowering or bad! I’d describe it as a light fresh cucumber scent! I also have the self-tanning body butter that I also love and use quite frequently for an all over subtle glow! I received these complimentary from Isle of Paradise and couldn’t recommend them more!",2
"For the price of this product, being honestly it is not completely worth it. It immediately started to make my skin tingle, but most things do that’s why I’m not going to give it a very low review. If you have rosacea or acne or sensitive skin this is probably not the product for you. Or a friend of mine that does not have sensitive skin it worked wonders for her.",1
I love this cleanser. Light exfoliation so I can use it every morning and doesn’t leave me dry or oily.,2
I love everything about it. A little goes a long way and it’s super moisturizing without being greasy. What I’m most pleasantly surprised about is that it actually helps with my normal puffiness.I received this product for free or complimentary for testing purposes.,2
"This lip balm feels great going on, but it didn’t moisturize my lips for very long. If I used this exclusively for just maybe 3 weeks it would already be gone. I love it; but it’s not enough product for the money.",0
Amazing product that eliminated the rosacea redness across my cheeks and nose. Looks completely natural and didn’t cause any breakouts. Only a small amount is needed to cover all my redness in one application - multiple layers not needed. I don’t need foundation after - amazing. I won’t let my container ever run out!,2
What a game changer!!!  Wow! I can’t believe that a little sample from PinchMe could really influence my decision to purchase this item.  My skin is changing and I needed something to really brighten it up and keep it happy.  After trying a sample from pinchme I ran straight to Sephora after I noticed it’s effects on my skin.  Pores are shrinking and my skin tone is evening out!!! Love it!!,2
It works well to cover my redness but this is not dry skin friendly. I have to almost make my face greasy with moisturizing products first to keep my skin from looking dried and cakey after putting this stuff on and I only use the smallest dab spread all over.  This was disappointing because I have a lot of natural redness and had heard rave reviews but this just does not work with my skin.,1
"This is a dry skin gals dream cream! I love to wear this under makeup to keep the dry patches at bay! It is lightweight, creamy and doesn’t get to greasy! I love this moisturizer I just wish I didn’t love it so much since it’s pricey",2
"Warning : You will never go back to ordinary cotton. These facial cottons may be bougie, but they are worth every cent.",2
I used it for about a week and all it did was make me feel greasy and broke me out.,0
I use it every night after cleansing balm. Leaves my face clean and refreshed and not stripped. Will buy the value size next time.,1
"The name says it all.!!!! The moisturizer looks thick, but it feels like water. And I loved the fact that it doesn’t feel sticky and oily after applying to my face. After trying some of their products, I’ve started to become a fan of theirs, because I have acne prone skin and I noticed my face has improved a lot.",2
"This product is worth all of the hype! I’m >25 yo, and I seriously am obsessed. Makes skin baby soft and clears so much texture/redness.",2
"I don’t understand why anyone likes this? It doesn’t work for me as the first step in a double cleanse routine because it barely removes any makeup, and it’s greasy, thick, and breaks me out.",0
This product is the perfect boost my skin needs. My skin runs on the dry side and sometimes even my super heavy duty moisturizer isn’t enough. I have always heard great things about the Josie Maran Argan oil but never tried it. Thankfully it was on the weekly wow so I figured why not! Since getting it (and getting a bottle free) I have given many people samples as I know they will be believers too!,2
"This mask is absolutely amazing!! It’s the food my skin craved for that I never knew I needed. It smells amazing enough to eat, has a lovely texture and leaves your skin feeling absolutely wonderful. I am usually lazy about my skincare at night but because this product is so good, I make sure I cleanse properly then apply this every night.",2
"I have dry skin, so I try a LOT of moisturizers. I love this stuff. Like, really love it. I use it at night after a serum or oil, and when I wake up, my skin feels soft and healthy. I bought a jar for my sister for Christmas and have recommended it to friends as well. I’ve also tried supposed “dupes,” but they’re not nearly as good as this product.",2
"I have oily skin and occasionally break out. This product has been perfect for these issues! I feel like my skin glows the next day. I also bought the AHA concentrate, which I apply before adding the mask to my face. I’m not sure if this has made a difference, the mask is great on its own. I also use the Ole Henriksen peel, which gives great results as well, but this product lasts longer for me.",2
"I received this free from Influenster and I love it, I for sure will purchase when I finish this sample. I slather this on my lips in a thin layer and wake up with smooth soft lips that look plump and lush. I recommend using a soft damp washcloth to wipe it off in the morning.",2
"I have PCOS and I’ve been lucky to avoid the acne associated with the disease thus far but I have the dry patches in some places and oily patches in other which is common with the disease as well. Im from Los Angeles and currently living in El Paso where my husband is stationed. The drastic switch in climates has destroyed my skin. Im home visiting and I bought this over the weekend. Two days of using it and my skin is almost back to normal. The amount of skin it removes without damaging the fresh and new skin underneath is nothing less than incredible. And for the amount that you get, the price is actually a bargain.. Dont be cheap with your skin!",2
"I live in an area heavy with pollution, bad air quality  you name it. whether I’m wearing make up or not I use this to prep my skin for all the goodness it’s about to absorb from my tatcha products. I was previously using IT Cosmetics makeup remover but when applied my eyeliner and mascara would always get left behind, plus it never left my skin dewy & smooth like the camellia cleaning oil did. love love the results.",2
I was sent this product complimentary from Skinfix to review. I loved using a thicker cream like this for the colder weather coming and it soothed my dry skin. It has really nice ingredients and I love the packaging! The squeeze top is so much fun. I do think that the ingredients aren’t worth $50 but the packaging is really nice and it’s an effective product!,1
"i have been using this product since it came out! It is my first cleansing balm I’ve ever used and i am in love! It does not break me out what so ever, it isn’t drying or too greasy, it leaves no residue on my face at all, It is perfect! Not to mention it is one of the more affordable cleansing balms out there! Totally give it a try!",2
This is the only cleanser that doesn’t strip my skin or cause acne!,2
"This gentle cleanser efficiently banishes New York City’s finest grime from my face. It is rich, but not at all greasy and doesn’t leave my skin dry or tight. Happy to report that it will gently remove even waterproof mascara!",2
"I really recommend this cleanser, it is the best cleanser i have ever used.",2
"Love this product! Great texture, nice light scent, gentle cleansing. Perfect for the whole family!",2
I’ve received this mask from Influenster complimentary for testing purposes,2
"This used to be my go-to, holy grail sunscreen. The new formulation (while now reef-safe) is not quite as coveted as the old formula. Something about the new formula that feels more oily and sits on the skin whereas I didn’t experience that before. For the trade off of being reef-safe, I still like this product but hope that supergoop continues working on their formulation!",1
I’ve been using this for the past few weeks and I have noticed fewer breakouts. It seems to be smoothing out texture as well. I’m impressed and will continue to use.,2
"On days I wear a full face of makeup, this is my go-to cleanser. I like to use micellar water to clean off some of my makeup but it does not completely remove everything. I then like to go in with this cleansing balm. It melts my makeup right off my face! Once applied to the face, it turns into a creamy oil texture. It removes even stubborn eyemakeup!",2
Its as good as everyone says. Only thing is the packaging but they came out with a lipgloss version and I look forward to trying that,2
One of my very favorite products! I will pay the $$ on it-never going to run out!,2
"she’s pricey but she’s AMAZING! I don’t use this moisturizer everyday, only when I wear makeup and it makes me skin look and feel amazing! Highly recommend!",2
"I don’t have a sephora close to where I live but whenever I do see one and find nothing else in the store I always grab this item! A few months ago I developed numerous heat blisters on my lips, bumps that you couldn’t see but I could def feel. It made my lips so dry and I tried everything I could find at grocery stores. This was the only thing that helped! Makes me lips moist and soft and makes them look plump. Def a regular buy for me.",2
"Please ! If you have enormous pores on your nose this is a must! I never write reviews but after trying almost every pore minimizing promising primer, toners etc… this one actually works!! I’m so excited. Finally something that tackles my crater pores",2
"Just okay for me. It’s not very poreless and I’m disappointed by that. I need a good poreless primer and this wasn’t it for me. HOWEVER, it’s a good primer. Grips makeup and seems to last for quite a long time. If pores aren’t your issue, then I definitely recommend this. But I’m glad I only received a sample from their website.",1
"MAGIC POTION. acne blemishes disappeared, evened out my skin tone, took away redness, even the darkness under my eyes. I just love it so much!!, just ordered a huge bottle. Cannot recommend enough!",2
"I love love love this dewy skin cream, I’ve had oily skin all my life in the Caribbean, now coming to New York and it’s gotten all dry. After trying countless moistures.This cream takes the win!! literally save my skin...Smell amazing,Super hydrating. Only downside is the price, I think there shouldBe more product in a larger container for this price. But nevertheless the less it does the job.",1
Best sunscreen I’ve ever used.,2
love this toner! noticed a softer appearance in 2 weeks also skin helps with textured skin,2
"The Good:- Has a lovely gel texture - A little really does go a long way, which I was very impressed by - A great summer moisturizer for combo skin - SCENTED, but didn’t irritate my skin. The scent wasn’t over powering either, has a nice fresh scent to it. If you’re going for completely unscented, this may not be it. The Bad- Alcohol Denat is the THIRD ingredient. This is a drying alcohol, which gives products a quick drying finish. It’s not great for the skin barrier, and some studies have suggested that the long term use of drying alcohol in skincare will outweigh any immediate benefits. According to Paulas Choi’s website:“Consequences include dryness, disruption of the surface of skin’s microbiome and barrier (the latter being especially bad for skin), and a strain on how skin replenishes, renews, and rejuvenates itself.”NOW people tend to be pretty split on how negatively alcohol denat is to skins long term health. So for some people this ingredient being so high-up on the list won’t phase them. If that’s the case, then I think this is a great product. If you’re a little more ingredient picky like me, this product would be a pass.",1
"I’ve been using this oil for almost a month, I haven’t had any significant drastic overnight improvement, but slow steady improvement on my red irritated cheeks. The first few weeks of using this I did get a few breakouts on my cheeks, but I pushed through and those are quickly fading except for two rather large pimples that may take a little longer to heal. I absolutely love using this oil, I use about 4 drops every night and I find it pure indulgence. It feels lovely on my dry skin, though I don’t have a problem with the texture of oils on my skin, especially since I use it at night. Contrary to many reviewers, I ADORE the scent, it smells of jasmine and I crave using this through the day for that beautiful scent! I’m hoping to see continued reduction in redness, and eventually some diminishing of fine lines. If I do see improvement on at least one of these areas I would consider this a worthwhile buy, since nothing has managed to provide those results yet.",1
"I rarely write reviews but for this moisturizer I had to. I initially tried this on the back of my hand in Sephora and noticed how nice the consistency was and how moisturized it made my hand. I knew I had to buy this. Safe to say this is my new go to moisturizer in my routine! Even though this says it’s a cream, it is a lightweight texture that leaves my skin feeling so supple and smooth after applying it. Highly highly recommend to anyone wanting a good quality moisturizer. 10/10!",2
"I’ve repurchased this last about 4 times already, work great, especially for small pimples, after putting on this mask the pimples are gone the next day♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️",2
I receive a sample and it worked so well I wanted more. From the moment I used it my skin was soft and smooth.,2
Very thick and hydrating. I have quite fry skin so this worked very well for me. I recommend.,2
I love how it’s so easy to use this product. I’m still trying it out but so far so good! I think it’s starting brighten my skin. I just love having this around me to get ready in the morning. The product was gifted from the brand.,1
"The Dermalogica exfoliator is everything I needed to complete my daily Skincare routine. It’s gentle enough to use every day and leaves my skin soft and ready for the day. I’m really amazed by it, as every exfoliator I tried made my skin break out and it wound up in the garbage. I’m a true “Dermliever” now!!",2
"I LOVE @tatcha products and so I was really excited when I got the chance to test their essence. I really like it! The packaging is lovely, and the product feels soothing and cool on my skin. It seems to calm any redness and boasts radiance. I’m 35, no Botox/fillers, and the pic is my skin naked with just this essence and spf moisturizer. I can definitely tell a difference!",0
I love this product.  I use it 2-3 times per week at night.  It makes your skin incredibly soft by morning. I will not hesitate to buy more once I run out.  I have had this jar for about 4 months and still have a month or two left in the jar,2
I have very dry skin and this face base has been so incredible to use. I hate when my makeup starts to look like it cracks because my moisturizer has worn off. This product has been a game changer for makeup application!,2
"Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream with Squalane spreads evenly and easily on my face and gets readily absorbed. I like the beautiful glow after application. I use it as foundation for my makeup because it is light and I don’t have to wait long to begin my makeup routine. It also has no irritating smell so it won’t interfere with my favorite perfume. Yet, what I find most important is the incredible length of time it keeps my skin moist and plumb. I can apply it in the early morning and still have my face thoroughly hydrated before bedtime.",1
"I got the water cream in October and fell in love with how the cream felt right when it hit my skin. It is light, hydrating, and cool as you massage it into your face; however, it gives the appearance of an oily (not dewy) face throughout the day. I don’t ever get pimples along my cheeks or forehead, but this cream has caused pimples in all those places. White heads and pimples underneath the skin became my new biggest concern. I stopped using this about a week ago, and my face has cleared up entirely. I’ve stayed consistent with my face wash during this process and have switched back to the belief aqua bomb and won’t ever look back!",0
I love this moisturizer! My skin feels sooooo good after using it! If feels like it just soaks it all in and leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated!,2
"Really wish i could use this product but the smell was incredibly strong and overpowering, i had to take it off right away, just a heads up to other people who are sensitive to smell like i am. It felt good on and my face was crazy soft even after just a few moments but there’s just no way i could get past the smell.",1
I don’t know how this product works for anyone. It’s super thick and hard to spread. Looks super patchy and makes your skin look grey. I’d much rather throw on a bb cream.,0
I received this product for free through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. So happy I received this product! I was very excited to use it! And I was definitely not disappointed once I did! It smells so nice. It doesn’t bother my sensitive skin! Leaves face smooth and bright!,2
This moisturizer is on the thicker side and I enjoyed putting it on at night but wasn’t a fan of using this in the morning. The scent is more on the perfume-y side which isn’t my favorite but it’s not a dealbreaker. Overall a good option if you like/need a thick moisturizer.,1
"for all my peeps with desert-dry skin...this is an absolute life saver!!! my skin type is dry and acne prone, I use this every night (instead of 3x a week as suggested), I do not experience break outs like I have seen in some other reviews (assuming its because my skin is just THAT dry). and it makes my skin so glowy! 10/10 reccomend.",2
"Wow this is a great cleanser. Won’t lie, I wasn’t the biggest fan at first. I have combo skin and when I used it in the summer it just didn’t do enough for my skin. It was a great first cleanse though. Recently my skin hasn’t been at it’s best and has become quite dry. This cleanser is a savior now..... it leaves my face feeling clean but moisturized as well. It just smells a bit funky and the product tends to separate if not kept in cool temperature.",1
Absolutely amazing. Feels nothing like sunscreen and is perfect for super sensitive skin.,2
I really enjoyed this product. It leaves my skin feeling fresh,1
"This is such a good moisturizer it makes my face feel so hydrated and moisturized, especially since during the winter my face tends to get more on the dryer side this was my holy grail. Even now since is starting to get a little bit more on the warmer side I just mix this with my foundation and create a tinted hydrating foundation because I don’t like to wear heavy foundation when it’s warm outside!  Totally recommend this product, you will love it trust me!!",2
"I’ve found my new favorite facial sunscreen! I cannot stand my face feeling oily or greasy, which most sunscreens leave behind, but this one is so lightweight and feels amazing! Makeup sits beautifully on top.",2
"it will probably make you break out at first. STICK WITH IT! it’s clearing your pores! it also might feel like its “burning“ at first which almost scared me away from it, but you get used to it with use. just try not to get your cotton ball too wet with product and gently swipe once across your face, not scrub back and forth. it has a mild exfoliant that sluffs off dead skin, causing fast cell turnover, leading to more even and clear skin. it has made my skin a lot less sensitive than it used to be and is so much more clearer and even. it even has helped with scarring! this is my favorite skincare product and will use it for life!!",2
This is incredible. I have never used anything that’s good in my life. This is a game changer in skin care. Yes it is pricey but there is nothing like it. I received this product free from Influenster for my honest opinion.,2
"I love this cleanser I’m on my second tube. It’s very refreshing and does a great job cleaning without giving that squeaky clean feeling like it’s stripped your skin. I have to say I’d probably give it 4.5 stars if that were possible because I have very dry skin in the winter (flaky patches) and this doesn’t help that. If I use enough moisturizer after cleansing it’s okay, but it can be the tiniest bit drying if used straight. Overall it smells amazing, feels really good on the skin, and definitely cleans my skin without completely stripping it. The price is a little steep for the big one, but it last me a REALLY long time so worth it.",2
"I received a free sample of this for testing, and I absolutely LOVE it! so wonderful!! it exfoliates very well, but gentle enough for daily use. It has not been too drying or harsh at all! It is very similar to the Tatcha rice powder exfoliant (which I have also used) but, in my opinion, this dermalogica is by far the better of the 2. I absolutely recommend this!!!",2
Ive used this for 2 nights and i already love it. It made a huge difference on my skin. My makeup looked amazing the next day after using it. It really helps alot with texture. Ive had hormonal acne the past 3 months due to pregnancy but this really helped! Im excited to see what more this will do after more uses. Ive tried the green toner but i have more dry skin so that one didnt work for me. I dont mind the smell to this one i actually love it. Ive seen reviews about it being reviews by people that have been sent this but this is my honest review!,2
"I really like all of the Peace Out products I’ve tried so far, and hopefully this one is no different. It’s suggested to start out slow with retinols if you have sensitive skin, so I’ve been using 2x a week at night. I hold the stick to my skin for a few seconds to let it warm up so it glides instead of pulling at the skin. My eyes have looked hydrated after use. Can’t wait to see long term use results!",2
I’d used this oil before but didn’t purchasepurchase again after using up what I had...I had a lovely face oil/serum that I used last winter but cannot justify spending so much! this oil is cheaper and works nearly (if not just) as well...so far no problems with dryness!,2
"So hydrating and the best cream for winter. I live in a pretty cold/dry area and have to bike sometimes, and this prevents my skin from drying out badly",2
"When I tried this daily peel my skin was dry and dull and longing for affection from me. It was easy to put on and not as messy as I thought it might be. I instantly felt like my skin was being rejuvenated. My skin feels so soft and looks dewy without makeup. I love it. The only reason I’m giving this 4 stars is because while my skin felt soft it didn’t keep my skin as moisturized as long as I would have liked. Of course, that might just be my skin drying out too fast on its own.",1
Love love love this! Provides a great base to my foundation.,2
"I really loved this! It works really well, and still has a decent lather despite being soap free. It’s perfect for my sensitive and acne prone skin! I would definitely recommend. It also smells FANTASTIC! I did receive a sample complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.",2
Very light oil. Did not increase breakouts. Brightened my eyes and reduced dark circles.,2
"I love this product.  I just started wearing makeup again after many, many years of giving it up.  Jumped into the Fenty line but found the foundation was ok but not amazing... a little off really (Gonna keep trying with it,...).  Anyway, saw a few YouTube videos on this and thought I’d try. Was skeptical about this but the color is a perfect match for me!!! Looks great. I’m super oily in the t-zone so not sure if I can really find anything to conquer that over 5-6 hours.  This is great for that length of time though.  Blot it and go after that!  Good to go for another few hours. So happy!",2
"Great cleanser for acne, combo skin, or if you want great deep cleanser. Great for cleaning your skin, gets all the oils out and dirt. I used this product for years myself and now my 9 year old daugher is using Murad cleanser. She was starting to get breakouts. After a few days her skin looks great. If you have really bad acne you should try the complete kits - would highly recommend this product and all Murad products!",2
"I received this product to try it and To be honest  I love it, it’s very soft.  when you Apply it to your skin you feel very fresh and it smell really goo too.",2
"This product was gifted to me by Skinfix. I am really loving this formula, it is on the thicker side but once you put it on its not heavy on your skin and doesn’t clog pores. I like that fact that is has no scent, and had my skin feeling super soft all day. I am going to use it at night before bed after my toner.",2
Don’t see any improvements but definitely hydrating under the eyes.,1
Immediate results: more even tone and texture as well as softness and reduced pores. I received this as a sample and will definitely be buying it!Minus one star for the smell... it is sooooo bad!,1
"This is a good oil, it does the job. However I saw practically no change in my skin after using it for about 1 month. It hydrates beautiful, sinks in fast, and my skin feels supple, however I have used many better oils than this one. I rely on my oils to do more then just hydrate, I have oily skin so I use oils to improve my scarring, acne, texture etc. If you have dry skin and need something to hydrate, go for it. But like the rest of us I expect more out of a 60$ bottle of oil.",1
This cleanser removes makeup and dirt. A great lather that leaves my face smooth and soft. Not drying.,2
"This product does what it says it will do. It definitely improves skin tone and texture. After using this, my skin instantly appeared to glow and felt absolutely wonderful to the touch. I use it whenever I feel that my skin looks tired or needs an extra kick.",2
"I absolutely love this product, it’s creamy and wonderful. I can go on and on and on about it. But I rather just keep it simple.",2
"I can’t say there’s anything mind-blowing about this lip mask. It’s great, it has a nice texture and is definitely soothing! However, it hasn’t really done much for me. Then again, I’m still searching for something that will lol. It’s worth a try for sure, it seems to work for a lot of people. Like I mentioned earlier, it’s soothing, but I still wake up with dry, kinda sore, sad lips that need some serious hydration that this product just isn’t delivering. It seems to just “coat” your lips nicely but not “soak in”.",1
"Since this is mainly meant to be used as a nighttime product, I figured it would be very moisturizing and Luxe compared to plain lipbalm. however after using it a few times, it’s not necessarily a bad product, it does moisturize but no more then a regular lipbalm would. for $36 I don’t personally think it’s worth the money. your basically just paying for nice packaging as it doesn’t do anything different then a regular 2 dollar chapstick.it also does not have a cooling feeling when applied if that’s something that you like. as I personally like that. this lip mask just feels like a very oily consistency on your lips. i see the appeal just not worth the money in my opinion!",0
"I’ve been using oil cleansers on and off for about 10 years but this one is the best I have come across. The scent is light, it dissolves my makeup and my skin is left feeling clean but moisturized, soft and supple. I’m in love ❤️",2
"I’m pretty frugal when it comes to skincare, but I’ll easily drop $48 to get some more of this product whenever I run out. This stuff is amazing, & works in a week or less. A Sephora employee noticed I had some texture on my face & had me rub some of the exfoliator on the back of my hand so I could feel how smooth it was afterwards. It really works!! LIFE CHANGER",2
"Definitely works, pimples are noticeably smaller the next morning. don’t expect them to be gone completely, but it does help a lot",1
"I have tried several gel cream moisturizers before and by far this is the best I have tried. Since I had tried gel cream moisturizers that didn’t quite hit the mark for me, I was hesitant to give anther a try. I was pleasantly surprised with the difference.  The texture is light but still has a creaminess to it. It gives just the right amount of hydration and smells so refreshing. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and all aopinions are my own.",1
This tonic is gentle enough for twice-daily use (morning and night) on even sensitive skin. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and I’m quite pleased with how my skin has cleared up and how my skin tone has become more even. The smell is quite nice as well.,2
"Three days in and I am in awe!!!  I actually think I look younger!  Am I crazy?!  This stuff is pure magic!!!  I have several sun spots and some acne (yup, 44 years old and I’m still fighting acne!) and I swear my skin is glowing and this serum is already making a real dent in my acne and lightening my spots!  I can’t wait to see what I look like a month from now!  Oh thank you, Ms Sunday!!!",2
This is hands down the best cleanser I’ve used thus far. It doesn’t dry out my skin and leaves it feeling clean without any weird residue. I have combo skin and this works perfect!,2
One of my favorite moisturizers ever! So light yet so incredibly hydrating and soothing! I have gone through multiple jars bc I love it! (Received from Influenster for testing purposes),2
have some problem with this product on sensititive skin,1
"As everyone else here is saying, the dead skin rolls off in a very satisfying manner. I do wonder how much of this has to do with “enzymes“ and how much of it has to do with the sodium hydroxide in the product--otherwise known as lye, a highly caustic chemical. Even if it is the lye working in tandem with the cellulose to exaggerate the efficacy of the product, I will keep using it. The formula is gentle on my skin and helps my skins refresh itself so makeup and other skincare products go on more smoothly. There is a noticeable difference after each use.",2
my favorite serum. my skin was SO hydrated after i used it especially in the winter and i have very dry skin. a must buy!,2
"A simple cleanser that has only done good for me so far! It’s gentle and the smell reminds me of a fresh cut lawn. Also, amount a half a pump is plenty, so this bottle lasts for a while.",2
"I got this product for free from pinch me to try out and I was very surprised. At first it hurt, but that was my skin getting used to it. And by the end of it I could see a difference in my skin.",1
I am 57 years old so you can image the obvious changes that come with aging. After using these products for only a couple of weeks I have had more compliments about my skin then I can ever remember. One person in fact asked if I’d “had work done?“(which I haven’t). That to me says it all. I would not say I have sensitive skin but I have been known to have breakouts with other products. I’ve had no issues with irritation of any kind with these. I will continue to use hope to maintain the “glow“ I’ve been told I have.,2
"It’s amazing, totally in Love with it. I usually don’t stick up to a night routine (we all just wanna get in bed quickly) but with this one, it’s just wonderful that you just want to use it and feel all the benefits, you don’t wanna miss them!With the Canadian winter, I’ve tried many lip care and nothing comes close to this one..",2
I really enjoy using this mask it’s very good at detoxing my skin and clearing up breakouts but it doesn’t seem to over dry it. It rinses off really easily and I didn’t need a huge layer of it. I received this product free for testing purposes but all options are my own.,2
I got this in my September Sephora box last night and I used to spot treat two large blemishes and I noticed a difference after I took it off they were less red and swollen feeling I wouldn’t use it all over my face it does tingle as it saysIt will but I feel it would be to strong for my whole fave I will defiantly uses this to spot treat anyBlemish.,2
"I’ve been a devoted user of Smith’s Rosebud Salve for 5 or 6 years, and everybody I know associates it with me. It’s one of the best products ever created. It keeps your lips tinted, conditioned, and tasting great, and it soothes dry skin in other dry places, like chapped winter hands and elbows. I love mint, so I thought I’d try something different and get the “minted rose“ when I ran out of the original last week. It’s still great stuff, but the mint seems to dry out my lips a bit. I’ll use it up, but I think I’ll go back to the original next time.",1
"This was a hyrdrating, oil free gel moisturizer. It didn’t make me oily, but it did leave my skin kind of waxy. The main reason that I gave this 2 stars is because this broke me out so much. At the time, my skin was already breaking out from a different product, so I wanted a moisturizer that would calm everything down without making my face too oily. I’ve tried this for a month and my skin was not improving. So I knew something was up. I looked up the reviews for this again and so many people had issues with this moisturizer breaking their face out. So I stopped immediately and went back to my old moisturizer. And within a week, my break outs were going away and my skin was smoother. Don’t know what it is about the moisturizer that broke me out, but it’s a shame that this didn’t work for me.",0
"I love this product. The texture is thin so I don’t feel sticky or to much oil on my face. I felt it hydrating my skin as soon as I put it on. A little goes a long way. The smell was also great, not to strong,  but just right. [product:korres-nourishing-probiotic-gel-cream-moisturizer] I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",2
probably one of the best moisturizers! Defiantly will be repurchasing!,2
One of the best under-eye creams I’ve ever tried. I have very sensitive skin and this cream did not irritated at all. It  kept my under eye area hydrated all day long. Love it! (I received this product complementary for sampling purposes),2
"This product made my face feel fantastic! I have oily skin and I loved how it made my face feel hydrated without being greasy. The first time I tried this, however, I used it under the micellar water that I also purchased from Sephora and this combination made my face very red. When I tried the micellar water underneath of this product I got a better result and there was no redness. I’m not sure why this is but once I started using the micellar water underneath, the turnout was a lot better. Would definitely recommend this product!",1
This cream feels sooo soft to touch! It almost feels like soothing balm to your fingers but its very easy to apply and not sticky. I have oily skin and it did not make it anymore oily. I’ve been using it at night time and love it so far!,2
Not quite sure who recommended this to me but immediately upon applying my skin started to burn and and my face felt hot. It was the most uncomfortable feeling I’ve had using a skincare product. My skin is a bit sensitive so maybe that’s the problem. I’m sure it works for some but it’s definitely not the toner for me. Will be returning,0
"I would not describe this gloss as “glowy” but almost everything about it is nice. The grapefruit smell is mild and pleasant, especially for something that sits right under your nose. The viscosity is just right too, not thin, not sticky, and gives a nice gentle glide when you rub your lips together. I have to reapply a couple times throughout the day, usually after eating or drinking, nothing abnormal. My only complaint is that I don’t love the applicator. It’s a standard plastic angled tip but the low end has a soft edge that runs really close to where the cap twists on. It’s not a huge concern but if you’re not careful you can get some product threaded into the cap.",1
"Love this! Yes the price tag on this baby is high, however she works! I’m almost 40 and I had a lot of deeper set wrinkles on my forehead, one specifically that was giving my a hard time. With this it’s softened to almost nothing. I have a very oily skin type and this doesn’t make me break out and it doesn’t make me oily. It also helps make my pores look better. If you’re thinking about getting this, do it! Results don’t happen overnight, be patient and will see it. I can’t stop staring at my face. ☺️",2
I received this wrinkle correcting serum to use for free in exchange for my honest opinion and I really like it. It’s easy to use and is applied smoothly onto the skin. It absorbs quickly and really helped nourish and smooth my skin. My dry skin looks plump and my face looks and feels fresh and younger.,2
Awesome product! Highly recommend. Easy to use and it seems to work.,2
"I am so sad to say that this product completely ruined my face. I am not new to retinol, but when first using this I applied it as if I were--that is once every two to three nights to start, with a night cream as protective layer. The entire day after using this for the very first time my face was insatiably itchy. Two days after (I was too afraid to use it again) my face was still itchy and my skin began peeling like I had a sunburn. I googled what was happening just because I had never experienced such an insane reaction. I found I was going through the reutilization process, so I decided to give it another shot.The itchiness stopped after four days and I began using this product again at that time. My skin however kept peeling. I upped use to every other night with the protective layer in between, and my skin completely broke out. My makeup was essentially sliding off my face, my skin was red and it was still peeling.I used this for just over a month. The peeling stopped after week two, but the redness and acne did not. It’s been two weeks since I stopped using this and I’m still trying to take care of the breakouts and redness.I do not have sensitive skin. I’m not on any medications. I stay out of the sun, but in case I’m in the sun for more than five minutes I use sunscreen. And this product completely ruined my face. This is probably the worst product I’ve ever used. Proceed with extreme caution.",0
I was really into this product because it made my skin super smooth! I only got to use it for a week but I would love to get the bigger one and continue using it! I love that it makes my skin like glass! This was gifted by Dermalogica sampling.,1
"I have been using this for about 2 weeks and its been pretty good. My face feels moisturized but not greasy. I have oily acne prone skin and this has not caused any additional breakouts. Previously I was using the Neutrogena gel moisturizer which costs about $20, had almost no affect and didn’t last very long. The only issue so far is that it does not do the best job of getting rid of dry patches that result from the acne. I think an oil would serve that purpose better.",1
"This is an HG product for me! It’s a little pricey, but it’s seriously effective. I have combination skin, and it gets a little red and blotchy sometimes because it’s so sensitive. This stuff totally neutralizes the redness in my face and makes it so that I don’t even have to wear a bb cream or foundation if i’m not feeling it. This new skincare line from Dr. Jart is really working for me.",2
"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Over the course of many years I have tried several makeup removers and this, by far is the best. You just apply it, so it doesn’t get messy with water everywhere.  Your skin is left smooth and moist after it’s rinsed it off. And most importantly, it works!!!!",2
"I have always used IT superhero mascara but was looking for a new foundation. As I have acne scarred skin and oily skin, I had heard great things about this foundation and decided to try it. It is amazing! I also use the oil free primer before hand and it goes on smooth. Takes about two pumps to give full coverage to my entire face and I followed it up with a medium color airbrush powder by the same company. Is it important to set it with a setting spray afterwards. It will last through sweat but if you wipe it with your hand or shirt it does come off. Highly recommended!",1
"I really like Fresh’s Rose Deep Hydration Sleeping Mask. I’m a lazy person so other masks that require wash off deter me from masking regularly. With this I can just apply the 2 layers (both which absorb quickly without leaving skin sticky) at the end of my regular nighttime skincare regimen and reap the benefits! The scent is a refreshing floral that makes it feel luxurious, not cloying, and doesn’t linger long. I have dry skin but when using this mask I wake up with plump, supple skin that’s clearly hydrated. I even wake up without the “11 lines” between my eyebrows that often show up when my skin is dry. The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is I wish that the ingredients were “cleaner.” (I received this product free from Influenster for testing and my honest review.)",1
Amazing exfoliator! This product is so thick and filled with exfoliating beads! Leaves your skin feeling beautiful and refresehed. Moisturise as soon as possible though! Get that moisture back into your skin X,1
"Very nice and rich for dry lips. It was much nicer than similar products I tried, as it wasn’t as sticky as mask from bite beauty. The only missing star is that although it leaves softer lips, you need to reapply after a couple of hours for continued hydration / gloss",1
"This really does quench my skin, keeps it hydrated, and overall makes my skin feel very smooth. The light scent is also pleasant. The -1 star is for the price, it is a bit high for the small amount received.",1
"I bought this product to replace Good Genes - Sunday Riley. Good Genes did a great job at getting rid of the tiny bumps on my forehead. At first i was really happy this product. The next morning after application my skin felt so soft and my pores looked smaller as well as any dry patches on my forehead were gone, the bumps on my forehead were less noticeable but still there. However after about a week, I would wake up and my skin was very sticky and oily. I started using it every other day,  but then the results weren’t as apparent. I tried mixing it with my Youth to the People moisturizer and that kind of worked. But what i noticed was the combination of the 2 would create the most foul smell when i would wake up. It smelled worse than Good Genes. In summary, i think this product does a good job at adding radiance to the skin, but doesn’t get rid of bumps as I need it to. I also haven’t found the right way to apply it in order for it to work with my skin. I wont be repurchasing.",1
"I received this product for free to review from Influenster and had never previously used an Dr Brandt products. I LOVE this sleep mask!!  After I put it on, I could feel the calming happening. When I wake up, the redness from my rosacea is COMPLETELY gone and the creases between my brows are significantly improved. My skin all over is so soft",2
Haven’t noticed any difference but it’s just 7$. Maybe I can it on my legs.,1
"I liked this product, it felt good on my skin and wasn’t burning like other toner like products.",2
"Great hydration for parched lips! A little goes a long way. I’ve had this tub for a few months now, granted I use it only three times a week I would say. I notice a huge difference in the moisture and texture of my lips the morning after I use this. I don’t need to use a lip scrub first, but I like to occasionally just to make sure my lips are extra soft. I want to try the other flavors soon.",2
I have sensitive skin and this is the best winter moisturizer for me,2
I absolutely love this product it tightens my pores making my skin feel so tight and moisturized. I love the smell of this too and the bottle is cute as well. I am definitely going to be buying this product again and would definitely recommend!,2
"A little bit of this cleanser goes a long way. It’s a gel but foams up when you rub it on your face. It has a pleasant, fresh smell and leaves your face tingly and soft. Also, it doesn’t dry your skin out like some products for oily skin. I would definitely recommend it.",1
"It moisturizes beautifully. I live in a dry climate and in the middle of the summer, my lips get so horribly chapped. After one use of this they are smooth and soft. It comes with a little applicator brush that I really like, so you don’t have to keep sticking your finger in the product. One jar goes a long way and is definitely worth the money. It also smells really nice.",2
This product really didn’t do much for me... I love Ole Henriksen but don’t think I’ll be buying this again. Smells good though,1
"I really like this product. It’s the perfect balm for my dry lips. It’s very moisturizing and has a slight rose tint. It smells and feels like Vaseline, but is longer lasting.",1
"I’m someone with that sensitive skin. You know, the one that if you change products suddenly breaks out and in the winter gets so irritated that even old, reliable products burn. This product has kept my face so hydrated, even in upstate NY (I run outside every day) and without a humidifier going. I use it every night no problem. It’s my go-to night treatment now.",2
"After using this for myself, i feel as thought this is probably overpriced. it’s a good cleanser but i noticed better results from a cleanser that was significantly cheaper. i do like the smell though.",1
"It’s definitely a cream for summer in dry areas. It has a very light and watery texture, not creamy or rich at all. But I feel it takes longer time for the skin to fully absorb the product.",1
"It’s a very light weight serum and feels so silky in the skin. It’s supposed to plump, hydrate and smooth the look of wrinkles. I’ve been using it once a week for about 3 weeks now. I could tell it was definitely helping to speed up cell turnover so I’m happy I didn’t go crazy and use it more than once a week. It does leave my skin with a beautiful dewy glow! Although, I prefer to put this on at night, it’s still nice to see my face glowy before bed. It’s a great product to add to my beauty routine.",1
Even after 1st application I feel different and nice glow next day. It litterally removes the dull skin cells. But it should be used in a cycle twice or thrice a week in night time.,2
"I really love this product. It melts away makeup including waterproof mascara pretty easily.  The smell is clean and not overpowering. It’s smooth on the skin and melts easily. It’s easy to remove but you do feel a bit of residue on the skin after washing product off with water. It’s meant to be the first step in a routine, so I follow up with cleanser anyway and it comes off easily. I received this as a sample from a Sephora purchase and when I was done, I purchased the full size product. Price is reasonable for amount provided. A little goes a long way with this.",2
"Did not work for me, weird patches everywhere. I prefer the jergens instant mousse.",0
This product is amazing! It left my skin super soft. It also gave me a really nice glow. It absorbs well on my slightly dry skin. I would recommend. I got this through Influenster.,2
"The best moisturizer I’ve ever used!!!  Despite the fact that my skin is combo to oily,  this moisturizer helped me calm my sensitive skin and it made it smooth.  And also it is very convenient as it can last an eternity( bc you need to use only an amount of pea)",2
I had the chance to use this product recently and I really enjoyed that it didnt leave a sticky residue. It was quite easy to apply. It left my skin feeling soft and renewed. Would definitely reccomend.,1
All time favourite chapstick. It’s the best. I love how it looks alone and layered with a lipgloss. My lips are never chapped and the tube is way more convenient than the tin.,2
"This is by far the most amazing eye product I’ve ever used , took away puff and dark circles, I’m not even needing eye concealer any more Amazing!",2
I have extremely sensitive skin and this worked perfect for me. In addition to sensitive skin I also have dry skin and this worked really well without being too light wieght or too heavy. I can say I have definitely noticed a significant change in my skin since using this. It is a huge jar and you only need a little per application so it’ll last you a good while.,2
My new LOVE! Surprisingly I didn’t breakout and my fine lines were less visible. I only use this at night currently since I read some reviews regarding sensitive skin mention breakouts. Recommended this to my mother and she fell in love with this too.,2
"This is such a beautiful, subtle tint. I’m such a fan of the formula. It’s buttery and very hydrating. The new packaging is such an improvement. The applicator works well and I don’t see the packaging leaking like the last one. So happy with this!!",2
"I didn’t know how much I needed this in my life! The Origins GinZing scent smells so refreshing and delicious, like a fresh orange peel. The moisturizer itself is a very luxurious, thick gel. It absorbs into your skin so easily, and leaves it feeling more full and awake! I was sent this product as a free sample, and I will definitely be buying more of it. It’s become a staple for my morning and night skincare routine!",2
"One of my top 3 fave toners I’ve EVER tried. So happy Influenster sent me this to try! It’s Insanely good for the price. So soothing, very hydrating, doesn’t feel drying since it’s a different texture but also doesn’t feel heavy. Also helps with skin imperfections like breakouts",2
"This is a really lovely moisturizer for oily/combo skin. It doesn’t feel greasy at all, and it sinks right in. No complications, didn’t make me break out. When my skin is dryer I added a couple drops of oil. Not sure how appropriate it would be for dry skin alone.",2
Smells great and make my lips feel so soft and hydrated.,2
"I usually wear the regular Confidence In A Cream and love them both - I like the lavender smell, though the lemon is my favourite! I typically use this in the evening because of the scent - I have combination skin and love that this cream doesn’t make me shiny - over time I have noticed a more even skin tone and way fewer fine lines and wrinkles. So time will tell on the anti-aging armour.",2
Perfection. Anyone that I recommend this to immediately falls in love. My skin looks and feels amazing. The smell is subtle and beautiful. A little goes a long way. I’d give this more stars if possible!!!,2
"I used it once and saw results. I put it on at night with my face lotion and in the morning my face is tanner. It smells like tanning lotion which some people like, I don’t mind it. I struggle with acne and it did not make me breakout, make sure when you put it on it’s even or it will look weird. I have darker olive skin and this blended well with my complexion.",1
"I didnt think I was going to love this as much as I do but, WOW! This is amazing. I have combo/oily + sensitive skin, and normally go for a light moisturizer throughout the day, but this summer after getting sun on my face and getting dried out from swimming, I felt like I needed something a little more moisturizing for night. This feels so nice, although if you apply too much it can feel heavy. I have never found an intense moisturizer/mask that hasnt made me break out, until this! I use it every other night, and my skin looks suuuuper glowy (but not greasy), in the morning my skin looks moisturized and it doesnt pill or rub off. There is a very mild scent which didnt bother my skin at all which is normally verrrry irritated by any type of fragrance. New holy grail for me, I will def be repurchasing!",2
this product is actually so amazing for people with oily skin. its a savior. seriously. the ONLY negative thing I have to say about this product is the smell is very strong. from the raw materials I guess? doesn’t really fade once applied. honestly a small price to pay for how well this product works.,2
I love me a thicc cream for my eyes for nights. And this is so wonderful and luxurious and nourishing. Will repurchase.,2
i’m literally obsessed. one good slathering and i’m set for the night. it’s almost 10am and it’s still there working miracles.,2
"I absolutely love how clear my skin has been since using the cleansing gel. I have combination normal to oily skin and this product has made my skin glow literally!!! I keep getting comments about how beautiful my skin looks. People that know me can tell there is a difference, but since I’ve never had bad acne they can’t seem to place what is different. I recommend this product to anyone who has dealt with clogged pores all their life that don’t seem to unclog no matter what you do! Oh yeah, and this product although it’s a gel is not overdrying like most.",2
"Texture was very nice, it smelled good, and had such high hopes because of the reviews but it barely took off my makeup. I don’t do a lot just mascara, foundation and bronzer took about 2-3 washes still dirty I end up using another face wash. Really disappointed.",0
"This lip balm is incredibly moisturizing. Usually I have to carry my chapstick with me everywhere (habitually applying it after every meal, etc.), but not with this stuff! It makes my lips for smooth for much longer. The biggest downside - it is very shiny on the lips and it takes awhile to soak in. I don’t think someone used to the look of chapstick would like the glossy look, but, if that is you, buy it and use it at night. It is worth it for the incredible moisture. If your lips get sore and peel like mine, you want this in your cabinet. I’ve been applying morning and night and that has been enough to keep my lips smooth and moisturized. This tin will last an incredibly long time, at this rate.",2
I received this when the line launched and I gave this a good go for a few weeks. I really wanted to see if it could hold up to many of the expensive serums out there. Some I’ve paid $100 or more for. This does seem to bring the glow out on my skin as it says. Using it regularly my skin looks very healthy. Didn’t notice too much else. This would be a product I would fall back on if I ran out of serum and was strapped for cash. I would also consider gifting it! I rarely get others gifts from Sephora because I am greedy and keep everything I buy for myself!,1
"I’ve been using it on and off for two or three years, It DOES works. I have oily acne-prone skin and use this to help with my pores, I see progress on my skin after a consistent 2-week use. My skin would flake a bit but after that stage I can see smoother pores. To people who have acne-prone skin like me, Please Don’t mix this with oil or overly hydrating moisturizers as DE suggested! It’ll just be wasting your money! If your skin feels too dry or gets flakey, just go easy on the amount of Retinol you use, or use light weight moisturizing gel, vaseline...etc. Applying oil or heavy moisturizers would just give you more acne to deal with. And please remember to apply sunscreen afterwards!",2
"I can’t believe I pay this much for a moisturizer but it really is the best.I’ve tried many that say they deep penetrate, last 12 hours ect. But this is the only one that actually does, at least for me. I put it on over retinol as well, which provides much needed moisture. No annoying smell ! What little scent there is, is very “ingredient smell”  as in an unscented moisturizer way. NO taste, if you accidentally get some on your lips. Do I think it needs to be this pricey?, noBUT props for coming in a glass jar. There are way , way too many pricey items coming in plastic and it just disgusts me. I expect the lush weight of a glass jar ( as well as health/environment reasons) when I pay a certain price. Am I going to purchase again? Yes, unless they change their packaging.",2
I quite liked the heavy scent of this product and I enjoyed how smooth and easy it was to apply. The product is thin and even in winter I used it under my sunscreen with no issues. I would buy again,2
"It’s true, this is an aqua bomb! My face feels so amazing. It’s hydrated all day. I’m obsessed with using this product along side the toner. My pores are gone, my redness is controlled. My skin is left feeling amazing. All. Day. Long!",2
"I absolutely loved the way this product felt on my skin and I could see a noticeable difference after 7 days of continuous use. The only problem I have with it is the smell. I know one of the product features is clean unscented beauty, but putting something on your face that smells like wet dog is a bit distracting from that key feature. It doesn’t last, but it does have a strong initial scent.",1
"Great moisturizer, my skin gets so dry from the sun and from the heater in the winter, this has been my go to since I got it. Works great",2
Such a great skincare product! I love Glow Recipe already and own multiple skincare products so i knew this one would definitely be no exception. It is so easy to apply and makes me skin glow. It also makes my skin feel hydrated and moisturized.,2
"I received this item free from Influenster to review. Ok I’ve used this everyday for 3 weeks as a primer and at night with my regular skin care routine. It’s awesome as a primer! I’ve tried it with light, medium and full coverage foundations. Instantly makes my skin all glowy an dewy. I haven’t had an issue with any of my foundations. They all lay beautifully on top. Now  i only gave it 4 stars because I have not seen my dark spot fade at all but I will continue using up the bottle",1
"Complimentary from Dermalogica. This delivers exactly what it promises.  I especially like using it after cleansing because this exfoliate gives my skin a extra boost. And my skin looks clearer, brighter and so soft.",2
"I never really spend over $3 on a pack of cotton pads. I heard so many great things about it I decided to try this $10 pack of cotton pads. From the first use I could tell the difference. This product is crazy soft, which is ideal for the eye area. I honestly will never use anything else. Worth every penny. Would recommend to everyone!!!",2
Background: had 6 dental surgeries in a span of 8 months and this took a toll on my lips. I needed more than just good chapstick. I found this and though I’ll try it since it isn’t even expensive. I cannot tell you how hydrating this is. I do not wake up with cracked bleeding lips anymore. A little goes a long way so this is a LOT of product in the jar. I feel this is a must have for normal lips too. I’m excited to try Laneige’s other products and really digging k-beauty.,2
This moisturizer has great texture and thin enough for hotter days. I have dry cheeks and this was very comfortable on my skin.  It didn’t leave my skin oily. It has a    slight smell but definitely overpowering.,2
One of my favorite creams ever. It boosts the effects of all the other products I use it with. Worth the buy!,2
It works! I applied it with face lotion for a week so far and it made my skin much better. I’m planning to combine this product with granactive retinoid *2% emulsion now hopefully it works even better.,2
this stuff is reallly nice. it goes on smooth and is not sticky at allll. the smell is amazing.like a rose and mint basically. just buyyyy it! i usually just slather it on thick and let it soak into my lips,2
Love this moisturizer. It gives your skin hydration and well as a dewy look. It’s thick in consistency but it applies beautifully and it is not heavy on the skin. It does have a slight scent but not too much. Great product overall.,2
"Love this! I usually use scrubs, and wanted to ease my way into using exfoliating acids. This is a really great transition product because you get the best of both worlds, and still get to rinse before applying moisturizers. Super pleasant texture and smell, and your skin feels like butter afterward! Careful not to get it near your eyes.",2
Love this classic salve.  My grand mothers swore by it.  I loved it as kid and I love it now.  It makes me smile about my grandmother’s every time I use it.  Love that I can now get this in a store again.  Great for dry chapped winter lips.  The rose scent is lovely and brings back wonderful childhood memories.  Had not seen it for years in stores I love that SEPHORA carries it.,2
"After over a month of use, I can’t say this did anything good or bad for my skin. Honestly, I was expecting my skin to react badly to it, but I’ve also seen no improvement in my skin. My blemishes last just as long and are just as irritated, the texture and hyper-pigmentation is just as it was before using it. The tacky, no frills formula doesn’t bother me and I use it day and night. I haven’t had issues with pilling under makeup but I also try not to rub products on top of it. For the price, give it a try but don’t expect miracles. This unfortunately is a pass for me.",0
This has been my go-to cleanser for the last 3 years. I’ve never stuck with a face wash or brand for such a long period of time. This is great for my combination skin. Not over drying and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Virtually no acne breakouts (other than a seldom hormonal blemish) since my first month of use.,2
"Just ordered this product but then a skin care blogger posted about how bs it is that this brand touts that it’s all organic while this contains plastic! So disappointed! I thought that by going organic, it wouldn’t contain plastic. Going to return as soon as I receive it",0
I used this product on my hair and loved the effects from it ! Left my ends feeling much healthier,2
"I’ve been using this product for years!!! i love it and i love First Aid Beauty in general. I used to use their red clay cleanser also, which does a great job as well. But in my opinion is better for taking off excess makeup/oil. i use it in the shower/every morning and i genuinely feel so fresh and clean. It gives you that nice clean feeling without completely drying out your skin too! I also use the FAB moisturizer afterwards, which is great for sensitive, yet combination skin.",2
"This has become a must have for me. It literally takes off every bit of makeup, even mascara. I actually got it because I had waterproof mascara and hated it because it was such a pain to take off. My friend recommended this to me and now I can’t go without it!",2
"I love this product. Smells amazing, leaves a nice gloss and I wake up the next morning with plump and hydrated lips. 100% recommend!",2
"I spent my reward points on a box of 3, and now I’m hooked! I purchased a box of 5 treatments after using up the trial, I’ve used one treatment every 4 days and my skin is totally transformed! My acne is dramatically reduced, and other than BB creme, I’m wearing no makeup. I really wish it weren’t so expensive, but it is worth it to have something that works. As everyone else says, moisturize, but I have sensitive, acne prone skin and the dryness has been very minimal, and there is no irritation. I highly recommend!",2
I have been using this moisturizer since last summer & I absolutely love it. It keeps my face hydrated during the day and I also apply it at night! My skin changed with seasons and this is a product that stays consistent with my skin! It’s not oily but it gives my skin enough glow to make it look hydrated!,2
"The mask loses the “minty” feeling after a third into the tube. Since the “minty” feeling disappeared, the  mask is nothing special The cap is on tight after each use!",1
I love this oil. I have acne prone . And mainly oily skin I want safaris I’d break out and get more oily but nope . My skin just feels hydrated and plump .it even soothes it when irritated  I use it in mixture with the tlc serum .. AMAZING . I wake up to glowy hydrated skin,2
"Don’t get me wrong the product works, but it left this weird blurry film on my eyes.",1
I’ve tried so many different patches and these are the only ones that actually work! Visibly shrinks the worst of pimples in just one night.,2
"Completely melts make-up and leaves my skin very soft, with little residue. And a jar lasts me a whole month. I’ve probably repurchased this product more than any other skincare or makeup item in the past year.",2
"awesome results, I use this product day and night, though it is meant for night. I love how smooth it glides on and the intense moisturizer it has. plus it has long lasting moisture so you don’t need to constantly apply. the rich formula is so comfortable as well. its now the only lip cosmetic I use!",2
This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. It is so creamy and hydrating and is not greasy. It doesn’t have a strong smell and makes my face feel so soft! My nose area gets really dry and flaky but this moisturizer always helps repair it. Highly recommend to anyone with dry skin.,2
"Yes! Finally found it! I’ve tried numerous vitamin c serums (Drunk Elephant, Ole Henrickson, Sunday Riley, Murad) and love this one! It’s the best as far as consistency (more watery (like an essence) and smell (very lightweight and almost no smell IMO). It’s also caused no breakouts for me! Hallelujah! Definitely worth trying this vitamin C serum for its brightening and anti-aging benefits.",2
I was gifted this from Caudalie but I really like this serum. It has a light scent and a milky texture. It’s easy to apply and a little bit goes a long way. I definitely could tell right away that my skin had a radiant look and appeared brighter. I can still see traces of my dark spots but they slightly improved. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox,1
This is my absolute favorite cleanser. It’s so creamy and light and lathers like a dream. My skin is left feeling clean but not stripped. I’ve noticed my skin has been almost completely clear and hydrated since I started using this. It really does make my skin look very dewy and it works wonders for pores. A little goes a long way and is still very effective. This is the perfect cleanser and is absolutely worth the splurge.,2
"My nose is always stuffed up because of my everlasting allergies. Which means I am a mouth breather, so my lips are always dry. I tried this lip mask and it leaves your lips so soft! I apply this not only at night, throughout the day works for me. There doesn’t seem to be a tint it goes on clear but that’s ok b/c I have pink lips anyway. My lips feel so moisturized.",2
"Disclaimer, I love putting heavy feeling cream on my face. Yes, this isn’t a light weight cream. But it doesn’t feel like it. My skin absorb it really fast and I don’t feel like I put butter. I put this cream on the weekend when i know it will stay for a while. If my skin feel dry after a fay outside, it’s my to go cream.",2
"After using it for a week, my pimples have mostly gone flat, but it does leave an ugly scar, which other products leave as well. As well, this product does dry out your face, like it says so pair it with very moisturizing lotion! It made my face peel but that’s alright because some of the scars are peeling off.",1
"Now, if you’ve got the money and enjoy a lux moment, go on & get it lol, I really don’t hate it, I’m just careful about where my money goes ;) I’m not giving this product 2 stars because I think it’s bad, it’s not bad at all.. I love Tatcha, but there’s so many hydrating sprays out there that do the same thing for a fraction of the price, literally I got one from the drug store that’s the same size as their full-size for like $10 that was just as good. I’m glad I got the smaller bottle because I don’t really like it for a setting spray over makeup, for me it’s really only good for extra moisture over skin care. That and I’d rather use it on their other products that really do offer real results and are worth the price. This is probably the only product I’ve tried from Tatcha (and I’ve tried many) that isn’t worth the price.",0
"I love this product so much. Overall, this brand is fantastic, but this moisturizer is my favorite. I have super sensitive, really dry skin in the winter and fall, but this product has given me the best skin ever! Super moisturizing without making my skin oily, and no irritation. My favorite moisturizer.",2
I use it before bed and it makes such a difference. It’s a wonderful product and their water mask for the face is great too! I love Korean beauty products,2
"I received this product complimentary from Dermalogica. This oil cleanser effortlessly melts away my makeup and SPF at the end of the day. I love how easily it breaks down my mascara for a fuss-free cleansing experience. It also leaves my dry skin feeling clean, hydrated, and nourished. This cleanser has a pleasant and subtle fragrance to it, which I love because I’ve found sometimes cleansers have too strong of a fragrance for me.",2
It was just ok when I first tried it. Decided to keep it and finish the product. After 3 weeks of use. It dried my out so bad. I have red dry patches around my eyes. Very disappointed,0
I was very excited to try this product. Unfortunately it caused my skin to be extra greasy to the point that grease was dripping off my face. Extremely disappointed in this product.,0
"I received this product to review from Influenster. The eucalyptus smell is amazing -- reminds me of a spa. The toner makes my face feel a bit sticky afterwards, but it keeps the afternoon oily T-Zone away. I definitely think this should be used in conjunction with the facial cleanser and moisturizer to see the full effects. My skin looks radiant and is becoming more clear everyday.",2
Amazing Moisturizer . I’m on accutane and have been using this for the last month and my skin has felt so much smoother and my texture (from dryness) is going away.,2
Love this product! The size of the item is totally worth the price.  I made everyone in my family try it. Lol,2
I have combo skin and this is great for dry spots and healing blemishes (helps the makeup stay on the area).,2
"This product comes in an unassuming brown bottle, but truly has many uses. I bought this on a whim and it was such a great purchase-- a little goes a long way, and I feel good knowing there are no hidden synthetic ingredients.I have been using this as a hair serum at night and have already noticed a difference in the softness of my hair after a few weeks.The bottle travels well and as it can be used for so many things, I am pleased to take this with me everywhere I travel.",2
"This product is not worth the hype. It has a STRONG and overpowering smell that I could not get past. Also, the smallest size is hard to dispense the product from, you have to put it upside and tap it into your open palm, and then spread it to your face. A lot of product is lost this way.",0
Amazing!! This product ACTUALLY WORKS. Wish I had this as teenager,1
"First of all this serum smells amazing which is a bonus but most importantly upon putting it on my skin, i can feel my skin becoming so soft. It creates such a smooth feel while helping to diminish dark spots. I love it!! I also received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",2
"I’m about a week into using this toner and I’m LOVING it! First, the smell is delicious! But ultimately it’s the effect on my skin I’m dying over! I have combination skin and I have see a dramatic difference in my pores (tgod)",1
My skin feels softer and my wrinkles look smoother after using Clinique Smart Clinical repair. I received this complimentary sample and can wait to buy it to include it in my daily beauty routine.,2
"I love Fresh. They make the most well thought out products and I was excited to see the pore refining claims on a daily exfoliant. It absolutely refined my pores. I literally noticed the next day, but I also noticed the massive breakout I had every time I used it. Like little red blemishes all over where the product was. I’m not allergic to strawberry; so, I don’t know why I broke out. Returning.",1
"wanted to love this product bc I love glow recipe. I tried it 3 different times in diff ways to fix the peeling. nothing really worked. It smells amazing, but their are far better options you don’t have to try to work with to keep from peeling.",1
I am a huge fan of this toner! It smells great and it works great! I have acne and dry skin and this helps all of it!,2
This stuff is amazing! I’m totally obsessed with it now! It made my lips even bigger because of how well it moisturizes.,2
"I really like this product, it’s good for my sensitive skin, has a weird fragrance but it doesn’t bother me. And it’s just a nice daily exfoliant",2
"I really liked Ole Hendrickson’s Cold Plunge Mask. This was received complementary by Influenster and I am so glad to be exposed to this product. I saw an instant decrease in my pokes and for a product meant for oily skin, it did not dry out my dry skin any further. I would recommend this to people with large pores. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",2
i love this product. i have sensitive dry skin so make up removal can be really drying and stripping. this product leaves my skin feeling balanced and not greasy. highly recommend,2
"I love this cleansing oil but find it much too dense to use with dry hands and dry face. I use wet hands, one pump only on my combination skin to remove makeup, then massage with more water before moving on to the exfoliating cleanser.",1
"Game changer lip mask! I was always the person who never needed any lip balm as my lips were never dry no matter what season it was. Somehow last year my lip was just so dry that nothing helped, Vaseline, vegan lip balm, lip butter, etc. I saw this and decided to try it. I can say 3 months later my lips have changed and are back to the normal healthy hydrated levels. I can even skip using it and my lips are still perfectly hydrated even during this cold weather. A little goes a long way with this so I feel this jar will last me forever. I dab a little on my lips at night and just wake up with soft and hydrated lips.",2
My skin gets so dried out in air conditioned environments. I love the instant revitalization my skin gets with this spray. It’s great for a hot day too! Love it.,2
I liked the product. It feels very light when applied. But it gets very tight when it dried down. Wait till the product is dry before putting any other product over it. I felt the product just just doesn’t do its thing as well if you just put cream after cream after cream on.,1
"Just wao!!! My lips look so hydratated, pink and natural. O loved this. One of the best I’ve ever used",2
In bought this hoping it would help with some dark spots I have . I got it as a sample thankfully because I have been using it daily for weeks and it hasn’t done anything at all.,0
"Such a great product! I have combination skin and it works perfectly. My skin is hydrated and soft, not to mention the healthy shine this moisturizer gives. Then there’s the scent - amazing! My new favorite!!!",2
"This moisturizer obviously smells incredible! The watermelon scent is so fresh and strong. I have been using it morning and night and it moisturizes well! I spray my face with toner first and apply a small dab everywhere, it brightens and softens my skin. I received this product gifted by Glow Recipe.",1
This is a must if you have problems with lips. You will wake up with silky soft lips. HG product❤️! (Also packaging is so cute☺️ :),2
I’ve bought a LOT of lip balms recently - this is the best.,2
"I’ve been using this cotton for over 10yrs ... It’s pricy but worth every penny, separate the square you get two application. Highly recommended.",2
"Super gentle in my skin, and removes my waterproof mascara with no problems!! Only con is that it’s sometimes hard to find in stock.",2
I already emptied a bottle and got a complimentary from supergoop! So exciting as this is my go to SPF when I go to work if I am applying make up! Literally unseen no peel off no I mean no white cast and best part non fragrant and super easy to apply! I have a oily skin and haven’t experienced any break outs so loving this very product!,2
"This cream is definitely a must-have, it worked so well for me! Didn’t cause any break outs, it minimized my pores, and it hydrated my skin without leaving it feeling greasy. The only reason I’m giving it four stars is because of the size, I ordered the mini and I knew it’d be smaller but I was surprised at how small it actually was. Lasted a few weeks though, and it’s a lot more affordable than the regular size so I don’t mind paying for it. I might buy the regular and see how that goes. Overall a game changer!",1
"I have super dry skin, but this product with just one use made my skin feel like silk! The product is not heavy or greasy in any way and my skin just drinks up the product. It is a plus that it smells wonderful! The only issue that i have with this product is the price, way too expensive.",2
"It is a good product, provides gentle and nice exfoliation, can’t complain about the quality and the effects. The skin is left fresher and more smooth, but... I feel like it is really overpriced (two stars off for that). There isn’t anything THAT special in the ingredients or the effects for this to cost so much. I’ve tried multiple chemical peels, and the cheaper ones do just as well (for example Ordinary), and my favorite ones by far are enzyme powder peels, which really do magic and are extra gentle and easier to use. I got this product as a free sample, and while I quite liked it, I wouldn’t buy or recommend it just because of the price. Unless you really want to waste some money, get something cheaper, it won’t compromise the quality or results you get.",1
"I think anything that has to do with this brand I absolutely love!! At first I did not know what to expect. Haven’t tried it for too long, but so far so good!",1
"I just realized after reading the comments that you’re supposed to use it on a dry face while I’ve been using it on my wet face, but it still cleans my face and I feel so refreshed after. You feel as if all the gunk from inside has just been washed away, no matter what the taste does get into my mouth like others have said but that’s nothing because the cleaning power this cleanser has! Must have for sure",2
100% satisfied.  It is extremely gentle and is more of a gel instead of a foaming cleanser.  I have dry skin and I’ve noticed that gel cleansers work better and don’t strip my skin as much as a foaming one would.  I don’t use this to remove my makeup; I use it after I’ve used a cleansing oil but any makeup residue left over always gets picked up after using this.  My skin is also very sensitive to strong fragrances and the scent of this cleanser is very toned down with a nice cucumber scent.,2
"This was recommended by Scott, my go to sales associate about anything skincare related! This moisturizer is doing great things to my skin! I typically have dry skin and in the winter it’s the worst. I’ve been using this for almost 2 weeks now and my face already looks/feels better. I highly recommend this moisturizer!!",2
"Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel is the most amazing and effective exfoliating facial product I have tried in years! I really enjoyed this two step process, it felt so good to feel your face being deep cleaned like this, and it is also very satisfying to look at the cloth to see all the gunk come off your face, this product works so well, even my husband of 12 years took notice in my radiant face after using this, and you know that is a big deal! I am in love, thank you.",2
"This is the beauty-secret of every club-kid, every college student who doesn’t look like h*ll on break, every commuter, and pretty much anyone who lives, works, or travels in the Arizona to Southern California area. It rehydrates and plumps out your skin, and just feels like your face is taking a deep breath of cleaner air when you spritz. I’ve never had a problem with mascara, but if this is a concern you can just hold a piece of cardbord or a magazine--or the side of your hand--over your eyes when you spritz your face.",2
This product was recommended to me in-store. I was using the NARS Skin Mud Mask which I loved but ran out of and haven’t been able to find. I insisted on a clay mask so I walked out with this one. This mask is not thick so you’ll need to put on several layers. I usually left it on for about 20 minutes at a time and used it 2-3 times per week. I found it very difficult and time consuming to wash off. I also didn’t notice much of a difference in my complexion after regular use over a 2 month period. I have combination/reactive skin and I break out when it’s that time of the month. I didn’t notice fewer breakouts or a reduction in pores or redness associated with breakouts. Luckily it also didn’t make my skin any worse or irritate it. I bought the Glam Glow Supermud Clearing Treatment today so I’ll see how that goes.,1
"Gifted by FreshI have dry leaning sensitive skin and I absolutely love this moisturizer ! It sinks in beautifully , has a lovely light scent and makes my skin feel comfortably hydrated . It’s just a beautiful product !",2
"I received a sample of this item through Influenster to test out. I had tried the original before and thought it worked well. This is very similar. A little goes a long way so I can imagine the bottle lasting a long while. It has a bit of a lemony scent to it. I do find it to leave skin a bit tacky after use. I think it definitely hydrates skin and leaves it very supple and soft. I’m not sure if it is worth the price tag, but I think it can definitely help your skin.",1
My favorite facial wash. It feels clean but doesn’t dry out my skin. My husband shares the same cleanser as me too and it definitely last long.,2
I’m obsessed with Dermalogica products. This cleanser does an amazing job for my skin. I massage it on my dry face and eye area to melt away dirt and makeup form my skin. It also removes waterproof makeup easily. Complimentary from Dermalogica.,2
"This is one of my favorite products and I always get them when I can. Unfortunately they can be pricey but the benefits are undeniable since you can see the results.It makes my skin heavenly soft, helps lighten red spots from my acne breakouts, tones, tightens and shrinks my enlarged pores. It also helps any products you have soak in well. :) My skin is sensitive and the extra strength doesn’t irritate it at all.",2
"Did absolutely nothing for my skin.  I bought the whole line and have not seen any improvement in my skin, in fact it looks worse.  Today I woke up with a huge pimple in my laugh line which is a very unusual place for my skin.  I plan to return the entire line.  I am wondering if this is all meant for younger skin, I am mid 40’s and oily skin.  Even though I am oily I found my skin looking very tight and leathery and my pores seemed more prominent.  Definitely a fail for me.",0
I love this product it leave my face shine free the entire day! Make sure you use sunscreen after applying it because since it’s an acid it can leave spots!!,2
This is the first make-up cleaner I want to use again. Skin feels great! Easy to use. Pulse a little goes a long way.,2
"I followed the suggestion to mix C-Firma with B-Hydra. Ive been using the two serums every other day for about 3 weeks, and my skin is looking nice! I had minor dry patches, but upped my moisturizing layer and it has settled. My skin is looking plumper and I hope to see more results with continued use. The only thing I don’t like is the bottle - it’s a bit too tall to fit into my shelf but the product itself is great.",1
"It’s always exciting to try a new product. Glow Recipe has definitely been one of my top preferred brands for skincare. I also love the fact that their products are Vegan, Cruelty-free, free of Parabens, Mineral Oil, Sulfates, Silicones, Phthalates, Synthetic Dyes, Fragrances, Drying Alcohols. Many products can bother my skin, sinuses and lungs if they hold a strong “perfumey“ scent. I’m so happy that the GR products always have a very light, clean, fresh smell when using them! The Avocado Ceramide serum has a very faint cucumber scent with a thinner creamy texture. It absorbed quickly into my skin, making it instantly feel calm and smooth. I really noticed a difference after a week’s use. The area on my nose and upper cheeks was visibly less red and irritated. I will absolutely continue to use this product in my skincare routine!! Thank you Glow Recipe!! I received this product complimentary of @glowrecipe",2
Best moisturizer I have ever used definitely worth the price. My skin has never been better drunk elephant products are AMAZING.,2
"This oil is unbelievable. I put 2 drops into my moisturizer every night. It has helped get rid of acne scars along my jaw line and I have not had a deep cystic breakout since using it. Every morning my skin is so soft and smooth, and my complexion is significantly better. If you suffer from acne I highly recommend",2
I’m unsure of how I feel about this product. The first dip in and application was lovely. Such a luxurious consistency and a beautiful feel on the lips. The issue I’m having is that I feel it left my lips dry and reapplying didn’t give them extra moisture. For the price I don’t think I would repurchase.,1
I love this product. I appreciate the hand written note that came with product plus an extra surprise. Will be using this seller for future purchases of this excellent product.,2
I am not such a huge fan of this. It doesn’t rub in very nicely- takes some work to make it all blend into your face. I also don’t like how it makes my skin feel and the smell of it. What I do like about it is that it feels like a true sunscreen so I believe it is actually shielding my face from the sun whereas some other skin care line sunscreens seem too light to actually be working.,1
"I am really enjoying this product. My face wash tends to dry my skin out, but using this product has given my skin hydration and plumpness! I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it can leave you a little oily (mostly found it around my nose), but overall this product made a huge difference. After using it for one night I found that my skin felt incredibly different. Plus, I really enjoy the smell! I tested this product for free from Influenster, but my opinions are my own.",2
"Great product, made my skin so soft and radiant after the first use.",2
"The staple of my skincare and beauty collection....this stuff saved my skin. Throughout my teens, I’ve struggled with sensitive skin and acne...just as many others. I tried EVERYTHING....nothing worked! It either worsened my breakout or got rid of the pimples but made my skin so dry, the natural oils were stripped which led to more acne..I tried this for the first time last October and I immediately loved it! My mother had a bottle of this and from the moment I put it on I could see a change in how my skin felt and looked. By the time a good month or so passed, the change was drastic! The only place I still struggle with acne is my chin but even then it’s not that bad, just hormones and all that. This argan oil helps and balances out my skin. Josie Maran is my favorite cosmetics line! I first love how it’s an organic brand which knowing that what I’m putting on my skin is actually good for it helps a lot...I love her philosophy of enhancing our natural selves but not masking our beauty..I own many of her products and I love them all. Whenever I wear her makeup, all I’ve gotten was “You have such nice skin“ or “Well you don’t wear face makeup that’s just your skin right“. That’s now natural and healthy her products make your skin look and feel. Just try it! I’ve honestly never owned makeup or skincare that worked this good for me!",2
this cleansing balm is amazing. it took off my heart to take off liquid eyeliner and waterproof mascara. it’s great for sensitive skin. it did not break me out. the only thing is be careful not to get this product in your eyes because it does sting a little bit. it did not dry out my skin. it’s so easy to use you don’t need cotton rounds or anything extra. I will never go back to the other stuff. cleansing balms are so easy to use. I got this product from influenster complimentary for testing purposes.,2
"This is definitely a very creamy, smooth butter moisturizer but I didn’t feel like it actually stayed long. Maybe it’s just the texture on my face that I’m not a huge fan of but it’s great that it’s unscented. It’s not my favorite face moisturizer but it gets the job done!",1
"Felt nice, smelled nice. I have combination skin and I felt like my skin was smooth and hydrated more than normal.",1
"I wasn’t sure what to make of this mask when I first opened it.  It looks like something you’d find near a swamp.  It’s a green/blue color and smells very earthy.  But I heard good things so I poured a little out (it’s runny, be careful) and smoothed it over my skin.  I felt a slight tingle upon application and left it on for 15 mins.  This mask rinsed very easily and left my skin feeling very smooth.  My serum glided in and moisturizer sunk in like a dream.  I’ve used this mask about 5 times since and I can say I think it’s does a great job exfoliating and resurfacing.  Recommend",2
"Bought these to be able to get a GWP last week, and these are hands down the worst makeup wipes I’ve ever used. I got the mini packet of coconut wipes, and they were barely wet. I had on a super light layer of foundation (think the amount you get in a foundation sample card where all you get is a swipe of foundation), and it couldn’t even get that off. The wipes did have a nice, light coconut scent though. I just wouldn’t buy these again unless I needed a $3 item to get a GWP. They were just too dry (almost dried up) and very small (about half the size of a normal makeup wipe).",0
Dr. Dennis Gross’ Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel does exactly what it is intended to do. I was very unfamiliar with the product but was very pleasantly surprised at how well it actually worked,2
Im about to order me a second one because I LOVED it!! Im 36 years young And I need a good moisterizer. This is one of the best ones I’ve found so far. You wont regret it!!,2
"Don’t waste your money! these are overpriced and don’t even work as well as the Nexcare brand patches. Honestly these were a waste of money. I bought them because I had a full on pimple with a whitehead that I thought it would easy take care of, left it on for 10, hours and it did nothing. Cannot believe these are priced at basically $1/patch when you can get 36 Nexcare patches for $5. Seriously everyone there is nothing magical in these and I am shocked at all the positive reviews. I used these for a week on a few different spots on jawline and forehead on pimples at various stages and it did nothing. Learned my lesson, sticking with Nexcare they clearly have their product down perfectly.",0
"I received a sample of this facial cleanser with a recent purchase. I was a bit nervous to try it since I have battled acne for years and currently being followed by a dermatologist to get things under control. The cleanser has a light, whipped texture which then turns into a creamy foam when mixed with water. It removes makeup and oil nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean, but not stripped. I don’t know that this product would get acne under control if you are in the middle of a bad outbreak, but worth trying....ask for a sample!",1
This lip mask is AMAZING! The small is so good and super moisturizer. it’s worth every cent,2
"Really good product. I have a naturally tan skintone and this evens out my face to the point that no foundation is needed. I mix it with the Protini moisturizer and love the combo. With muggy and hot days, this is perfect for a no makeup day.",2
Don’t do it! Will make you break out .. I said what I said,0
"Tried this as a sample a couple times before deciding to purchase the large size. For whatever reason, I really struggled to make this work for me. My skin is normal/combination usually and I had a hard time layering anything over this. Whenever I did, it pilled, or flaked off, or clumped up, or my makeup separated over the top of it. I was hoping for something that would take the place of liquid foundation in my beauty routine and even out my skin tone. While this evened out my skin tone, it just didn’t work texturally. I tried layering it in different order, mixing it with other moisturizers, etc. and nothing worked. It just made my beauty routine more complicated. Not really sure why this didn’t work for me since a lot of others raved about it, but it didn’t so I had to return the large tub. Great concept but failed in practice. Not sure what else I can use to even out skin tone...",1
"So far so good. It hasn’t broken me out and I have sensitive skin. I use it once I get out of the shower, but it is a little sticky. Doesn’t feel bad on my skin. I didn’t notice a smell, but ingredients listed fragrance. Maybe omit it in future formulas? I received this product complimentary to test and review from Influenster.",1
I received a sample of Bareminerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum and it was great. Bareminerals is an amazing brand and this serum felt great on the skin. It left my skin feeling nice and moisturized.,1
"This is a nice moisturizer that didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, I also enjoyed that there really wasn’t a fragrance. It is lightweight but moisturizing, but a little on the pricey side. If you want to splurge I would recommend this moisturizer.",1
I used it once and my skin broke out overnight. It’s painful and red all over my face and I don’t even know what to do now. I have dry skin and no acne. I do not recommend this product to people with dry and sensitive skin.,0
"The Face Base is such an iconic product. This priming moisturizer is so moisturizing that I would definitely see this being ideal for people with a drier skin type. When I had oily skin a few years back, I felt like this was a little too heavy for my skin. I now have combination skin and I love it. A little goes a long way, so I’d start with a pea-sized amount. It gives the slightest tacky feeling, which helps the makeup to adhere, but it’s nothing obnoxious or uncomfortable. This is definitely a pricey product, but I think it’s such a nice product.",1
I absolutely love this moisturizer! I saw more difference in my skin’s elasticity and tone within a week of using it. I would have given it 5 stars but the bottle isn’t convenient for long fingernails.,1
"I have tremendously fair and sensitive skin, including rosacea and this cleanser is fantastic. Doesn’t irritate my skin, a little goes a long way and it easily takes off my eye makeup too. And it also smells nice unlike other cleansers that have a cleaning agent scent to them. Definitely recommend this product!",2
"I really wanted to love this product, but it was too drying for me. If you have dehydrated/dry skin, this aint for you, especially not in the winter. I thought my skin was gonna be fine, so I gave it a shot, but it did exactly what the reviews said. It’s sad because the product feels so fresh on your skin and it smells good (for those complaining that the smell is gross, it smells green but in a fresh pleasant way). I have really sensitive skin and it didnt cause me any trouble other than the dryness. You can also use half a pump to wash your face, its plenty, otherwise you will go throught it quickly. A bit overpriced in my opinion. I’d say its better for combo/oily skin. Theres better options out there in terms of price. Too much hype around it I think. Will probly just finish the rest of the bottle this summer, when my skin goes back to normal.",1
"This product smells sweet, just like candy, but that’s where the benefits stop. This is basically overpriced LipSmackers. It does nothing to hydrate my lips, even with morning exfoliation. I put it on before bed every day for two weeks and saw no results. Don’t waste your $",0
"This product was gifted to me by Octoly to test in exchange for my honest opinion. When I first opened this I wasn’t to sure how I felt about the way that it looked, but it works amazing. My skin has never felt so refreshing. It makes me feel like my pores are completely drained of everything and I can start with a fresh face everyday.",2
While this mask helped control oil for a few days after use it did nothing to rid blackheads or clear/prevent acne. I won’t buy it again but it was wirth the try.,0
"I have a bit of eczema on the side of my face and on both of my arms, and applying this even just once a day really helped decrease the redness, smooth away the dry bumpy texture, and heal it faster. I also have a bad habit of licking my lips during the winter, making the corners of my mouth crack and become dry and red. Applying this before bed helped soooo much",2
"I’ve been using my 100 pt large sample for a few weeks now and am amazed! I used it one night for the first time and forgot about it for 2 days but the entire time, I kept seeing my reflection in the mirror thinking to myself how bright and clear my skin looked. Then I remembered my one usage of this product and started to apply it regularly for the last few weeks. It really does get better with time! I have had issues with red skin that is a mix of past damage and sensitive skin, but my skin looks flawless when I use this. I could see where it might not show a huge difference for just slight imperfections but for me.... I actually went out without my mineral foundation for the first time in a long time! I’ll stretch the sample while I can, because let’s be honest... it’s more expensive than I normally buy. BUT, I will be buying a full size bottle of this!",2
"First of all, this lip balm smells like a coconut dream and is so so hydrating! It’s a main factor in my everyday makeup routine to keep my lips moisturized all day!",2
"i just bought this at sephora and it works amazing. the smell is like a very cactus-fresh or similar to leaf-fresh smell mixed with watermelon smell. it made my skin glow but it’s a bit sticky, which isn’t really a problem if you put moisturizer and/or other products over it.",2
I have acne prone skin so I always look for a good scrub. I love the grittiness of this exfoliate. I use this at night and St. Ives Apricot Scrub in the morning. Alternating the two has not caused my skin any problems.,2
This product smells amazing and keeps your skin hydrated all day long! After only a week I do feel like it was tightened up my skin some and look forward to using it again! Would definitely recommend!,2
"I love, love, LOVE this product. I’m a student so my eyes look permanently tired with circles and bags. Not any more!! This eye treatment is incredible. I use it every night before bed as part of my routine and I wake up with less puffiness and feeling great. It’s also great because it stays where I put it so it doesn’t slide into my eyes as I start getting into bed.I have sensitive skin and this caused no issues with me. I will never go back to another product again. I’m so happy I received this product to test for free.",2
"This product is unbelievable. I had previously been using a cleanser by Mario Badescu but decided to check out Drunk Elephant because of all the hype...Best decision of my life! The difference was night and day. This cleanser applies so smoothly, lathers nicely and feels soooo gentle on my skin. Immediately after washing it off my skin is GLOWING. My skin has never felt stripped or overly dry with this product and I have seen a noticeable difference in the quality of my skin after using this just a few times.",2
Love this product. I swear the pores on my nose nose shrunk!,2
"the holy grail of skincare. if i could take only two things with me to an deserted island, i would take this and some sunscreen.",2
This moisturizer is really great for my oily/combination skin. It has a gel like texture that soaks into the skin without leaving any greasy feeling. My makeup sits well overtop of it. It’s good in the morning or at night.,2
I love this product !! I i’ve been a fan of this brand for many years and their products never disappoint. This one especially has become one of my new favorites I love the way my skin feels and I will be telling all my friends about it definitely worth purchasing again in the future,2
This lip balm doesn’t work for me... It wears off too easily.,0
"Hi beauties, I recently bought this product because of my very dry and sensitive skin. So far I can say that it does help with the hydrating part. I like to put this in the fridge and use it every morning with my moisturizer. I haven’t feel any irritation on my face so far, so that’s a plus!",1
"So this product says to apply a couple squirts with dry hands and face. If you like applying Elmer’s glue directly to your face and trying to spread it then it’s just like this product. It’s sticky and thick and needs just a drop or two of water to help it glide properly.The smell is supposed to be pineapple. I smell more of a tropical fruit punch koolaide scent. It’s not terrible, but there is too much of it.If you’re okay with those two things then it works well otherwise. Makeup and grime come off easily, and it leaves no residue afterwards.",1
Like many others I got this as a birthday gift from Sephora along with the cleanser. I was really worried at first that it would break me out but it’s totally done the opposite. I just got this yesterday and have used it twice and I see and feel the difference. Both the cleaner and the mask are very lightweight on your skin and gentle. I see that this item is pricey so as the days go on I will see if I will be back to purchase the larger version. So far so good,2
"I give this one star for being non-irritating. I love cleansing oils and balms. I am an avid double cleanser. But this product is a huge miss for me. It’s extremely hard to squeeze out of the tube. It feels overly greasy whether used damp or dry. It doesn’t melt into skin and dissolve dirt and makeup like other effective balms do. It doesn’t rinse well or make the skin feel pleasantly clean. I’ve tried multiple methods/combos of wet, damp, and dry use. I have no idea why it’s often sold out other than the low price. I’m going through the inconvenience of returning this product because I will get zero use out of it. Simply awful.",0
Shade is a bit dark on pale skin but works good as liquid highlighter on cheek bones!,2
"very good product, will buy again",2
"One of my favorites, this is a staple. Really improved my skin tone. Great product!",2
thank you so much for the opportunity to try this. So far I can say it smells nice and an little bit goes a long way. I have found it to be hydrating. It does stay a little sticky even after I allowed it to dry down which I am not fond of but other than that so far so good. I look forward to seeing what the long term results look like.  I am using it twice a day morning and night. with the water it still just feels like a serum.,2
"This scrub is amazing for waking you up, or washing the day away! It makes my skin feel so luxurious after using it, and makes my skin feel so fresh and clean after using it. I will continue to purchase this. Thank you influenster for sending these products free for me to test, because I’m obsessed!!",2
Love this product but after continued use may dull in ability to moisturize. I have oily skin,1
"I was worried about that one comment saying the texture is similar to vaseline but it’s definitely not (or we don’t know the same vaseline, like thick, sticky,  greasy). It’s melting and really pleasant on the skin. Also does a great job at removing makeup. I had the Tatcha Camelia oil 2 in 1 and I really prefer the Green clean.",2
"I have dry, sensitive skin.  I was very surprised to see that when I used this product my face became very itchy and red. I wasn’t expecting this reaction from such a “pure“ and quite expensive product.  This product does offer A LOT of moisture, which is great for my dry skin, however the redness and itchiness is not ideal.  It does have a fragrance. Unfortunately, I would recommend this product for people with combination skin and those with no sensitivities.  I am interested in buy more Tatcha products, but am afraid I might have another adverse reaction.",1
I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes and I was so thrilled to try it.  It has a pleasant scent that’s not overpowering and it’s very luxurious.  It’s very silky and it keeps my skin feeling moisturized throughout the day.  It absorbs quickly so it’s a very nice base for foundation.  I haven’t noticed a dramatic change in the overall look of my skin but it certainly keeps my skin soft.,1
This product is easy touse. And it is a multi-purpose product.You can either use it as a scrub or a mask or both.It leaves the skin very soft and smooth,2
wonderful product was such a incredible blessing. thank you sephora for the blessing to sample such great products. Our family loves your store so much,2
I usually don’t like serums at all but this product was recommended for my dry skin. I am in my 40s and trying to prevent wrinkles like crazy. I was so surprised at how smooth this product made my skin in just a few days. I mainly can notice my neck. It had little dry bumps on it and lines. I actually noticed a difference from using this product which is I think is rare!,2
Really great product I love the smell most of all and how soft it has made my face ! Also I’ve noticed I look more glowing that usually .,2
"Favorite product to remove makeup! It gets everything off, even waterproof eye makeup or long lasting liquid lipsticks. After I’m done using this, I’m used to using toilettes but my face is clean and the toilette has no makeup to pick up. Highly recommend!",2
"I received free samples of this in my PinchMe box and of course I’m always a bit skeptical when it comes to eye creams because I’ve tried numerous ones, well I’m definitely going to splurge on this one! Yes, it may be a little more pricier than some out there but it’s definitely worth it!!! By day 10 I could honestly see a difference in my dark circles under my eyes and the puffiness had just about gone away! I was blown away! I freaked because I was on my last packets of samples so I went out that same day and bought a full size bottle! It is definitely a must try!!!!",1
"I usually have really dry skin. Dull and patchy. Ever since I started using this about two years ago, my skin has been so moisturized and bright!",2
This stuff is amazing...and the price is unbelievable! I highly recommend only using it once a week. This is pretty strong but well worth it.,2
Totally worth the money! Someone had told me about this before but I hesitated because of the cost but I wish I would’ve tried this before. Totally love this product. My skin is so clear and radiant than its ever been.,2
"I Love this night moisturizer! My makeup goes on smoother and I can’t stop using it. I had really dry skin due to the winter but I don’t now. It is expensive but you don’t need much which I always need to remind myself because I always seem to put to much of this on because it feels so nice. It is hard when you open it, it reminds me of coconut oil but such a great Product. I can’t say that it has helped with wrinkles but regardless A+ and my holy grail that I use every night.",2
"I’ve heard nothing but good things from this brand, however I was underwhelmed. Granted, I’ve only used the product for a few weeks, but there hasn’t been any change, good nor bad. As far as a serum goes, I would not recommend. I think it is fine for a touch up stick, but the price is not justified for that alone. Perhaps effects over longer periods of time are great, so I will continue use but probably won’t purchase a second one.",1
"Seriously belief’s items are always a hit for my skin. I have been battling with dry skin problems and although this item applies on as a sticky gel consistency, it completely hydrates and nourishes like no other! this is definitely a purchase worthy item! Disclosure that this was a free item for my unbiased opinion!",2
"I really liked this product. It’s lightweight, not greasy, and absorbs quickly into my combination/sensitive skin.  Worked well under makeup and didn’t cause breakouts.  I actually feel like it made my skin look tighter and younger. It has an unusual smell - like something fermented (or beer) - but I came to enjoy it. I liked that it didn’t have artificial colors/scents.",1
this really helps even out my skin tone. it’s perfect for those hot days you don’t want layers of makeup on but still not have a naked face.. definitely a staple for me for the summer,2
I LOVE THIS WRINKLE CREAM!!!!    Received a sample of this and loved the feel.   Bought the full size and have used for over a month now.   It really works!   I use it around my mouth where the wrinkles were getting deeper and deeper.   They are now much less.   It really makes me look younger without all the deepening wrinkles   Live in Arizona where it is dry and the wrinkles were deepening.   No more!   They are smoothing out perfectly.,2
"Best spot treatment! After one use, the swelling, redness and tenderness were all cut in half! And a little goes a long way therefor it lasts for a very long time. Goodbye pimples",2
"I’ve been searching for a clay based mask for a while now. This is my first time trying this brand, and I really like it! This product is clarifying, not drying, and doesn’t seem to crack and tighten uncomfortably when on the face. The texture is creamy, and spreads easily. Afterwards, my skin was clean, soft, and helped tame the onset of my hormonal acne.",2
"This was my first origins product. Thought it was pretty effective, usually use it as an overnight spot treatment. Good value for money. Will probably repurchase",1
"I have heard about this lip mask all across social media. As winter was approaching when I was shopping, I decided to buy this product. It has been amazing! Love the taste & feeling. Not a thick consistency but also not thin and slippery. Very conditioning. Usually I’m struggling with chapped lips already by this point in the dry season but I’m still going strong! If you wear a lot of liquid lipsticks, invest in this. The jar will last you so so long and you always need a good, not chapped skin base to make your lipstick look as best as it can!",2
"I’m totally amazed with the results of this ultra facial cream, keeps my dry skin moisturized for longer time. This cream is great for am and pm routine, it left my skin feeling smooth and silky after each use. It has super luxurious texture and absorbs quickly into the skin. This unique fast absorbing cream provides water replenishment throughout the day and leaves smooth and moisturized skin for hours and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy.",2
"I really love this product, it works well and makes my skin feel great.  However, I wish it came in a bottle format instead.  I can’t justify all the wasteful packaging.",1
"This was my first product from The Ordinary. First of all, it was so affordable. Second, the packaging is very chic and the dropper is extremely useful. Third, this product is AWESOME. Some reviews said it burned, it peeled, etc. I did not have those experiences at all, and I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin. I apply this twice a week, all over my face and neck. I let it dry, and then put my moisturizer on over top, and go to bed.Not only has my skin texture been smoother from using this, but my stubborn adult neck acne has drastically improved. I can’t believe I got this product for $7. It’s an absolute steal.",2
"This moisturizer is amazing. I love how lightweight it is on my skin but still manages to hydrate my dry skin. I have really dry skin, especially in the summer, and this has been my saving grace! It moisturizers me without my skin feeling heavy or oily and you only need the smallest amount of this moisturizer to get the full effect. This will probably last me such a long time since a little goes a long way! I definitely recommend this product for someone with sensitive, dry skin like myself. I received this product complimentary from Influenster and Lancome for testing purposes!",2
"This stuff works! And for the price it should. My skin just drinks this up. I have been using it night and day for about three months and my skin is brighter and my freckles are lighter. I have to say I am addicted to this product. It is light yet hydrating.  The only drawback on this product (and it is a big one) is the price. I am pushing the big 50 and have combination skin, but slighter in the drier side (living in desert).",2
"Absorbs, hydrates, soothes..’nuff said..Buy now.",2
"This is one of those moisturizers that needs time to soak in to your skin. It doesn’t soften your skin immediately, but apply in before bedtime, you’ll be sure to wake up with soft and hydrated skin.",1
It’s the best! I don’t go anywhere without it! Leaves my lips wonderfully full and soft!,2
Finally something that truly works. At the same time it reduces the size of the pimple it doesn’t make your skin peel.,2
Awesome all year long but definitly a must have in cold weather. so hydrating and soothing. The minted version adds a nice feel. Plus it gives a really nice glossy finish and is non-sticky. A lot better then more expensive ones. I have one with me all the time. A keeper!,2
"This is an AMAZING sunscreen for those who haven’t found their perfect one yet. I opted for this recently over a rebuy of another “invisible“ sunscreen (which I enjoyed as well!) purely based on oz vs cost. I prefer this formula, higher SPF and it’s smoothing",2
I’m in love with this product it changed my life been using it for a month in love it does what it says it’s just perfection,2
"I got this product while in desperate need of getting hydration to my dry skin, while I wasn’t too impressed with it on its own it didn’t break me out (which is rare for me with most moisturizers) but then I started putting it on at night and after letting it sink in 15-20 min adding the TARTE Maracuja oil (which I also find doesn’t do much for me on its own)  over it and then wearing just the moisturizer during the day under makeup, my skin is glowing and so soft and still no break outs. Loving the combo and just thought I would share.",1
"Ok. I’m just as shocked as you are. This LA is more effective than the “genetic” LA from the company with the name of a certain day of the week. I know bc I have both of them and this one has done MUCH more for my skin, and I’ve only been using it for one week. I’m 36 years old, so believe me—I have my share of skin issues. Texture, hormonal cystic acne, bottomless, stretching pores, dryness, shall I continue? My skin now feels bouncy, soooo smooth, pores are less noticeable. It’s honestly incredible.",2
"This is the best eye moisturizer I have ever tried. My friend recommended it to me, or I never would have looked into it. The reviews made me think something is special with this stuff. Let me tell you — this IS very special stuff!!!! If you want to soothe and moisturize your delicate eye tissue, this is an amazing product to do just that. Every time I use it, I feel like my eyes have been to their own little spa.  Worth every penny. I paid for this product and thankful to have done so.",2
I do not notice this product doing anything for my skin. I have been using it morning and night and nothing..... I purchased it with the hope of reducing under eye circles and puffiness but I see no results.,0
Most amazing moisturizer! It’s so rich and creamy. It really helps if you have dry skin so I definitely recommend it. Last a very long time so I think it’s worth the money in my opinion. Favorite moisturizer.,2
Quick and easy way to refresh your skin. My skin felt noticeably softer afterward.,2
"I wasn’t sure I was going to like this, but I really do. It really hydrates my skin and calms redness. I’m super pale, and it definitely helped to even my skin since i’m naturally red on my cheeks all the time. I gave it a 4 because i’m not sure it’s a holy grail for me yet",1
"It’s a really lovely eye cream. Not too heavy, not too light. Honestly reminds me of the regular Advanced Night Repair Eye. I can’t really tell much difference. But it blends in like a dream and looks amazing under makeup. My eyes feel refreshed and moisturized. I can easily see myself buying more in the future.",2
"I only had a sample size, but in the short time i used it, i did notice some improvement in fine lines.  Lightweight and very hydrating. Only need a small amount. I will buy this again. Would definitely like to see what it can do over a longer period of time.",1
"I purchased this oil based on the great reviews, and it did not disappoint! I have normal/combination skin, sometimes dry and sometimes oily. I was nervous about using an oil on my face because being in my early 20’s I am still prone to breakouts. My biggest concerns were with the size of my pores and blackheads on my nose and chin areas. I have been using it for about a month and I can notice a change in my skin already, much more moisturized without any breakouts, a little reduction in my pores, and it has helped prevent a lot of blackheads from appearing. My skin glows in the best way. It is a bit pricey but the bottle will last a very long time since only a little bit is needed at a time. This is now a must have of mine and I highly recommend!",2
"The name of this product is accurate! It feels so nice and easy on the skin, not greasy at all. I used one pump worth, but I feel like I could have even used a little more and it wouldn’t have been too much. It filled in some of my fine lines and I think my foundation overall looked very smooth as a result. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.",2
"I love the cream, calms skin, deeply hydrated and creates an amazing glow.  For my skin though, I have to use either at night or when my skin is usually dryer in the winter",2
Overall happy with how smooth my skin became!! Smell is awesome and it’s not sticky which is a plus !!!,2
I really like this product!! It goes on really smooth and it doesn’t leave a white cast. I reapplied throughout the day and it never felt heavy or greasy. I’ll definitely buy again.,2
"I have dry, sensitive skin and this has been my go to cleanser for over a year now. I have gone through multiple bottles. When I first started using it I wasn’t sure it was doing much until I went without it for a bit. It never leaves my skin feeling dry or stripped, and I feel like it actually leaves a bit of a glow. Nothing has worked quite like it in my opinion and will continue to repurchase over and over again.",2
"Smells wonderful, makes for a light, hydrating moisturizer for summer and a great serum in the winter.",2
"Beautiful product, provided great moisture but unfortunately this caused me to get closed comedones on my forehead. Just not for me but it had worked very well for others I know!",1
Stop buying cotton squares from the pharmacy. These are amazing and they don’t leave little bits on your face/eyes.,2
"I called my local Sephora and luckily they had one left in stock and put it on hold for me. All the other Sephora stores near me said they wouldn’t get it until mid-Feb. But, this cream is AMAZING. I use it for my lips, dry area, under eyes, etc and it’s great. It’s super creamy and a bit oily so a little goes a long way..seriously, a little dot is all you need. I’m guessing this will last me at least 6+ months at the rate I’m using it.I would certainly recommend this to people who have normal to dry skin. I don’t think this is something someone with oily skin should use. Also, it has a nice lemon-y scent which is not strong at all. This is just the perfect cream. Another win for Josie Maran.",2
"Just wow !! After struggling with breakouts recently, my skin has been so dry and dull from harsh products and over exfoliating. I think that only a few days of using this product has brought my skin back to life ! I have been using it in the mornings with my normal skin care routine. It goes on smoothly and doesn’t feel sticky or flake off and my makeup goes on flawlessly after using it. I definitely have seen a difference in my skin’s tone and texture and I can’t wait to keep using this product.",2
"I always watch to try it! Was looking many artists working with it an now I know why is so popular! Two in 1 , moisture and primer, great right! One step less to apply, works great, makeup least all day and gives flawless canvas for your foundation!",2
"I really wanted to like this moisturizer because I needed something to soothe the damage of hard water on my sensitive skin, and my trusty gel moisturizer wasn’t quite getting the job done. However, this felt really heavy, thick and didn’t absorb very well. I have sensitive, cystic acne-prone combination skin. The product claims to be “lightweight“ and easily absorbed, but it left a greasy layer on top of my face that felt sticky for hours after applying. I also broke out really bad within a day of the first use, which doesn’t happen with my usual routine. Sadly will be returning this one. :(",0
"I was initially skeptical about this product. I previously used the Lancome makeup remover, but wanted to switch when I found out that they test on animals. This product took off ALL traces of my makeup, even better than the other remover I used. And it left my skin feeling really moisturized! I liked it so much I went back to Sephora a few days later and purchased more Josie Maran products!",2
"Great oil for glow & hydration with no breakouts & minimal, healthy ingredients! The eye oil is fantastic too.",2
"I love it, it maintains my skin really well. I’ve noticed that as long as I use this product in the AM + PM I don’t have breakouts. I also noticed that if I do occasionally have breakouts around my period they dry up before they can even really become pimples. I have bought 6 bottles of the larger size of this. I’ve been using it for almost 2 years. This + their glycolic acid and a very basic, generic, non-scented face wash. My breakouts are much more maintained. I really rock with this product because of the price too. I’m still working on clearing up scaring from acne as a teenager.",2
I really love this oil. I use it on my face. I have combo/oily skin and this works great for winter. My suggestion is to put it on while your skin is still damp. Just argan oil and eye cream and its good to go!,1
This showed no visible signs of improvement or change to my skin in over 2 weeks of using it. Also didn’t care for the scent.,0
"I hadn’t heard of this brand before I received it for free in my Influenster VoxBox in exchange for my honest review. I love that the brand uses natural botanical ingredients, that is always a plus in my book! I’ve had crows feet for YEARS (thanks genetics), and have a hard time with makeup settling into the fine lines around my eyes. After using this moisturizing eye bomb for about 2 weeks now, I am already pleased to see the difference in plumpness around my eyes. This stuff is magic and I will definitely purchase when I run out! Highly reccommend!",2
"This little guys pack a powerful punch. I suffer from melasma (dark patches on the cheeks, chin, and forehead) caused by a prescription. Once I discontinued use of the prescription, these babies helped speed the process of fading my dark patches and brightening my skin.Love to keep these in my gym bag as well!",1
"For years I was a Biotherm user, and decided a few months ago to change my regime to products without questionable ingredients such as parabens, etc. Saw the great reviews for FAB, and I’ve been extremely pleased with the results! FAB Face Cleanser does an excellent job washing and removing makeup without overly drying out the skin.",2
"I only had the opportunity to try one of these, And it definitely made my skin feel tighter! I know some people break out though so that’s one warning I would give people.It’s decently expensive though, this is more of a luxury product for anti-aging... But less expensive than Botox I suppose",1
"I have severe eczema on my hands and this is my miracle cream. It’s not greasy, it’s not scented, and it works like magic.",2
"I think these are nice products that do appear to brighten my pretty normal/slightly dry skin. Not sure how well they work on more oily skin. As some other reviewers mentioned, the scent is pretty bad. So much so that I am not sure I will buy again. The good genes works well under makeup and a couple friends did comment how nice my skin looked. The luna was a nice feeling oil. I’ll continue to use and then decide. Probably like the good genes the better of the two though.",1
"This is my holy grail and I cannot recommend the product enough. There are instantaneous results with a more even and GLOWY skin tone. The moisturizing is deep, but not heavy enough to feel oppressive in humid or summer climates. This is a fantastic daily moisturizer.",2
"Absolutely loved this magic cream. A little goes a long way to make my face hydrated and glowy. This product also helped as a base for my makeup, and it does not look cakey at all. I definitely recommend this product.",2
Love it so much! Makes my skin look so much more even!,2
"Love this product! I typically have trouble finding good face cream because of my skin type but I absolutely love the way this feels upon applying, and after hours of wearing!",2
"I received this for free to review & I’m so happy I did! This was my first time ever really using a serum & oh my goodness I was missing out! I’ve been using it for a few weeks & I’ve noticed my skin feels so much smoother, silkier, & very hydrated. It doesn’t have a strong scent which I love, the ingredients are clean, I will definitely be purchasing more in future!",2
"First off, the container is brilliant. The scoop never gets lost among my many products. The balm is fine, no better than others. I like the little exfoliating bits, but I wouldn’t buy it for that. I probably won’t repurchase. At the price, I think I can do better.",1
Love love love...totally recommend. Great for dry skin types. Very hydrating.,2
This is my favorite recent Sephora purchase. It is amazing for removing make up and feels so good on my dry skin. While it may be pricey a little goes a long way. Will be repurchasing this.,2
"I got a sample of this product and when I went home and waited for the 10 minutes, WOW was I impressed!! My skin was brighter , softer, shinier, and my lines GONE!!! I was so excited I went back the next day and Purchased it and i told my sister about this AMAZING Product and she tried it and was shocked! well I have been using it for 2 weks and I was told at a Family gathering I looked 20 years Younger!! , Try it You will be AMAZED!!!",2
"Never wrote a review in my life but this product deserves it! After cleansing, I always look forward to massaging this moisturizer into my face. It’s super lightweight, no fragrance, and for someone that is oily acne prone, I have not broken out from it nor am I oily as much as every other moisturizer I have used. I use it morning and night and in the night I use it on top of the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Concentrate.",2
"Gets it all off!! It leaves me feeling so clean that I don’t even feel like I need to wash my face after (I still do because I’m a skincare freak but it just feels that good!) It’s not messy or gross feeling like so many cleansing oils/balms I’ve tried before. It just breaks down EVERYTHING and gets it all off. Was recommended to me by a friend who uses it to get their heavy drag makeup off and it works like a charm! The only thing it could use a little work on is mascara, but I think that’s the case with every oil/balm remover I’ve tried. Honestly it would probably get it off if I were patient but I’m not so I guess I can’t blame the product lol",2
"I received this as a sample and I can say it didn’t work for me, it felt like I was caking on gel around my eyes and I felt like I had to wash my face",1
"In shock that this has so many 5 star ratings. I am a major clip glam advocate. This stuff is not good. I put it on, in 15 minutes it’s totally gone and my lips are left cracked and chalky. For $18 I expected so much more.",0
"I received this product for free for testing purposes from Influenster to try in exchange for my honest review. I dis notice my skin was softer but I didn’t notice much else in the time I used the product. Since the product is a moisturizer I would say it did its job. However,  I’m not sure about youth power.",1
"I received this complimentary sample from influenster for my honest opinion.  The sample was small so couldn’t get a true feeling of its worth. What I tell is the scent is light, it didn’t feel sticky,  and was hydrating.",1
"LOVE! easiest way to remove all your makeup, including mascara. I’m on my 3rd and I don’t see myself changing any time soon.",2
"This Moisturizer is one of the best I’ve ever tried! It is so hydrating, my skin feels plump and healthy after applying, and that feeling lasts all day! It’s very gentle too, not too heavy, and sinks in to the skin really quick, It is creamy without being greasy .I really love the texture of it, and it feels really nice and smooth when applied. I also like that it does not have a noticeable scent or any irritating ingredients. It makes my skin a blank canvas for my foundation. My foundation looks better than ever after applying this. My foundation doesn’t look cakey. It goes on very even. This cream keeps my skin moisturized and hydrated all day.",2
"Alrighty, so my main concerns are pigmentation, protection and having a really gorgeous glow and this product is literally it! I love anything vitamin C because it helps with uneven skintone, firming (boosting collagen production), and fights pollution damage! A little bit goes a long way, and I’ve had mine for about 7 months and I have about a 1/3 of the bottle left! I mix it w a moisturizer to give more moisture and it helps fade my pigmentation! FREAKING FABULOUS!!!!",2
"For my oily, acne prone skin, this is almost similar to a dupe for the (now discontinued) Dr. Brandt Pores no more mattifying moisturizer. Yep, it actually makes my skin matte. I think it’s the Greek Mastic Gum in it, which is doing the trick. Two drops of this oil on damp skin in the morning and night and now my pores have disappeared in two days. I do not need to blot my skin and my texture is more even. It almost looks as if I have a pore minimizing primer or serum on!!",2
"I really like this product and have made argan oil a skin care staple! However, I have researched other less expensive argan oil products and find they are comparable. I do use other JM argan products, but I will not pay this much for the oil when there are other options. Argan oil gets 5 stars, but JM’s argan gets 4 because of the price.Also, a note for people with nut allergies - beware. Sephora may want to mention where the product comes from when touting it to avoid customers experiencing a reaction since many people suffer from nut allergies. Do your homework, also.If you don’t have nut allergies, though, it is a great product!",1
"I like this a lot. I did dry out my skin a little, though. Also the mini lasted me over two months.",1
"I received this complimentary from Influenster but my thoughts are my own. I’ve been using this product for about a week now. I really love the packaging-it is luxe and feels substantial like i have come to expect from tatcha. The product is easy to dispense (i love the angled spout) and it seriously hydrates my face. It definitely helps me feel bright and clean, but it is quite a luxury product and I don’t know if i could justify the price to repurchase.",1
"I really enjoy this moisturizer on my very dry, sensitive skin. The dispenser is also wonderful.",2
"I absolutely love this product,its so creamy and moisturizing,and it makes your skin so soft and perfect to prime for makeup",2
"Honestly, no reason to not give it 5 stars.I have normal skin, and refrain from any face cream. I just can’t stand the feeling of it on my face and find it heavy.I have been using this moisturizer after my toner for 4 months now, and it’s done an amazing job. I love that it’s light weight, so refreshing, feels amazing, smells amazing, yet does the trick. Very good if youre looking for a regular routine and a light weight moisturizer.",2
This is my 4th jar of this moisturizer. It is my absolute favorite. Great for my combination skin and leaves a nice glow. Little goes a long way!,2
I really like this product. It absorbs great into my skin and it doesn’t leave my skin feeling too oily. I wear it on top of my serums without a problem. My skin feels comfortable. I have been wearing it for about a week. It has not caused any issues with my skin.,1
I love this product by Dr. Dennis Gross! I received this Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel as a sample from PINCHme and I loved it! My skin felt so soft after I used this every night. I definitely recommend this.,2
Love the smell but unfortunately made me breakout.,0
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. All reviews are my own and unbiased. The product I received was a sample size containing approximately 7 days worth of product, so this must be taken into account. The texture of this serum is a nice texture. Not too thick or too runny. The scent is light and unbothersome. After a week of use,  I did notice my skin was more hydrated, but other than that, there was no difference. I did not notice any improvement in fine lines and wrinkles, nor did I notice improvement in radiance. I would not recommend this product. There are better products on the market for this purpose. I am a 39 yrs old Female with fine lines around my eyes and on forehead.",0
"I have combo/oily skin so this is a dream. Light weight, mattifying, when I put it on it almost creates a filter on my skin. And then it has salicylic acid so I’ve noticed that it does help with my texture and acne. However this is NOT meant for dry skin. It’s meant to hydrate enough, while keeping oil at bay. And the salicylic and willoherb can be drying. I love it.",2
"The packaging is beautiful and luxe and reminds me of the St Germaine liquor bottle. the texture is a little strange at first, but you just have to pat it in and give some time I cannot slap my spf on right after Its very thin and clear and can run so a little at a time is needed. I’m not super young but since I take care of my skin I’m not seeing the results someone more dehydrated and drier (less oil production) would see. radiance comes with hydration and this is described as a triple threat 3 in 1. as far as claims for plumping, I’m not sure I have enough lines to tell. I don’t think i would repurchase. it will take me a long time to use up. the dropper dosent always grab the beads because the products settle. the smell is more prominent than some might like but not unpleasant. its a gourmand sweet smell, almost like a sweet perfume. it does linger on the skin. I love the honey bee on the bottle thats also from recycled glass, I will probable repurpose when its empty. but I still feel really lucky to have been gifted such a gorgeous product to review.",1
SO obsessed with this! It makes my skin look even-toned and healthy. I was not expecting to see such quick results.,2
I absolutely loveee this balm. It makes my lips so smooth and healed all my chappiness from the winter. I wear it every morning and every night. I’m still on my first container but got a second one already to stock up. =) Definitely will be buying again and again and againnnn,2
My favorite sunscreen/primer out there. Well worth the price. A little is all you need to cover your face. Lightly scented and made my skin feel soft.,2
This stuff is pretty amazing.  I’m not very consistent when it comes to putting on eye cream and given that I’m 37 I really should be. Since I got this I actually look forward to putting this on. Love the pump and it feels cool and refreshing. I also love that it’s not greasy and it doesn’t cause my make up to smudge after morning application. My eyes have gotten noticeably brighter.,2
This crème feels wonderful on my skin. It’s nice and creamy but not super thick that it feels heavy. Has a light scent which smells great too. I have super sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate me at all. Feels silky smooth on my face and absorbs very well. Highly recommend!,1
"This stuff is amazing. The formula is great for sensitive skin, and I love that it’s vegan. It left my skin feeling soft and hydrated, not dry like some foam cleansers. I would recommend this product if you have sensitive or dry skin. I was sent this product for free in my Influenster box to review.",2
This is the best retinol eye product I’ve ever used! Not only is it surprisingly moisturizing but it also cleared up the milia under my eyes. Something I have been struggling with for a long time. The application is quick and easy and doesn’t leave you wasting product on your fingers as you just swipe it on straight from the applicator. I will be purchasing this many more times I’m sure.,2
"I have always been a big fan of Shiseido and I was thrilled when I received these 2 versions of sunscreen from Influenster!! This version is oil free, tinted and has Hyaluronic acid! It glides on my skin! I use it as a primer. My skin looks great and protected too! It doesn’t leave a white cast unlike other sunscreens. The packaging is so cute! Spf 42 is another best thing!#influenster #complimentary",2
"I keep trying other things and always come back to this! It’s a great price for the quantity and isn’t full of unnecessary ingredients. Perfect balance of hydration without leaving a greasy residue. I only have to buy this once-two times a year, unlike other moisturizers that don’t last more than a month. I use it in the winter months and in the summer as my night moisturizer, especially if I’ve had a lng day in the sun!",2
I’ve noticed a big change in my skin by the product once dry gets all peely on your skin and rubs of very easily. But besides from that I love it!,1
"My semi-sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin loves this stuff. I added a couple drops to my usual moisturizer and woke up the NEXT MORNING to see my usual splotchy redness gone. Just gone. In the summer I can use it by itself and it’s plenty moisturizing since my skin gets more oily in the summer. I like the smell (and it fades quickly). This is on my very short list of products that don’t break me out. Pricey, but it works some sort of voodoo magic miracle and makes my skin luminous so I’m not mad about it. A bottle will last you forever.",2
"This is the perfect skincare to makeup primer hybrid.I apply this as the last step on my skincare routine before doing my makeup and it gives me a plump, hydrated and smooth surface to work on.My makeup glides smoothly on top of it without pilling and I always get a radiant finish.I even like to use it on no makeup days because I love how it makes my skin look! Highly recommend!",2
I absolutely love this toner. Also it’s Bipoc brand so that’s a bonus!,2
I love the product... and this size is perfect for carry on when flying!!,2
Nice and good quality product. Will purchase it again.,2
"I’ve owned this for about 1 week, I’ve never written a review for Sephora BUT I had to for this product because it’s THAT good. Due to my eating habits I’ve been suffering from really nasty acne and this helped me clear up OVERNIGHT and without drying the s**t out of my skin like every other single ance product I’ve used. Be prepared for it to tingle !",2
"So far I have used this product a handful of times. It feels pretty thick but I was able to get it on well with minimal to no streaks - so that’s good. I don’t like makeup looking blotchy so I’m happy to see this doesn’t seem to do that. I don’t think it gives a matte finish for me but it’s not shiny, either. More of a “natural“ finish, I guess. So far it seems to be working decent - which is great for me as I have sensitive skin and usually have big break outs. I usually use a mineral powder but I have been enjoying this product for a quick application. I love it for a very busy mom like myself. :)",1
"I bought both the medium and light shades. The light shade I used on my face and the medium I used on my legs. I would say overall I really like the product, especially on my face. It applies evenly every time and looks beautiful. The problem for me is my legs, I cannot seem to keep this from being streaky on my shins no matter what I do. I have switched lotion consistencies and that has helped somewhat (I have super dry skin and was using a super rich lotion to try to combat the crazy itch that tanning products create on my lower legs). But even when using a lighter lotion, if I put this on and went to sleep, I feel like the tan got shifted around on my legs from rubbing against sheets/my other leg. God forbid you put on pants and cross your legs etc. so while I would say it’s been very good on my face/upper body (and it doesn’t make me break out!) it has been tricky for the lower legs/feet.",1
I love this product. It keeps my lips while I sleep. I gave it as a gift to two other people. It comes in different flavors. The best flavor is grapefruit which was a special purchase in 1999.,2
I was sent this complimentary for my honest review. I started getting dry skin with the winter weather and this has been a life saver! I apply before my make up and it makes my skin feel moisturized and so soft! Definitely recommend giving it a try!,2
"I recieved this complimentary from Goop Beauty Goop Glow overnight glow peel from Octoly. As a fan of peels I was very curious to try it out. I have pretty dry skin so achieving a glow can be difficult for me. However, not with this product! I noticed a difference after one treatment. Not too mention the ingredients are awesome. I will definitely be purchasing more from Goop Beauty to try!",2
I received a sample of this product for free. I enjoyed the application and feeling it gave my skin. Was not able to get multiple uses out of the amount received so cannot speak to long term or multiple uses. It felt very nice and would purchase when in need for a serum that feels like it is actually doing something. Nice product as far as I can tell  #free product,1
I’ve been using this for over 2 weeks now and it’s sooooo good. keeps my lips baby soft and it smells so nice and sweet too. 10/10 recommend,2
The worst product ever tried. Save yourself the chemical burns. I’m never buying anything from this brand again.,0
"Love this moisturizer!! Lately my oily skin has been drying out, but this is really bringing it back to life. I’ve only been using it a week and I already see a difference!!",2
"Leaves skin soft and smooth, I use this twice a week.",2
"Overall, this is a pretty good moisturizer and it left my doing feeling super smooth and soft. The only downside for me is that it’s scented and too perfumey for me. If it didn’t have any fragrance added I’d like it a lot more.",1
"Very basic. Lightweight, affordable, and doesn’t interfere with makeup. It’s not crazy moisturizing so maybe use ponds or something more at night.",1
Not worth the money. You can buy a cheaper toner that works better,0
"I purchased these as I wanted to help even my skin in many different areas. These have helped make my skin overall brighter, clearer and smoother. I was using them daily then minimized to only a couple times a week or less. After awhile I had an awful breakout with pimples all over my face due to trying a different product and went back to using these daily and they cleared it up within days and minimized the hyperpigmentation that those pimples have caused. I repurchased these as I think it will become a main part of my skincare as it’s one of the few products you see results from, making the price worth it. I use their face wash prior (pore cleansing gel) and use it when I don’t need the wipes as well to maintain.",2
"I want to start by saying this smells amazing! I’m usually nervous about face products because they smell harsh, but this smells so nice! (Kind of like oranges) the packaging is simple and pretty. I like how smooth it feels when I apply to my face. It’s so lightweight- I don’t feel weighed down by this. I like to use mine after I let my renewal serum dry. It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated, it’s crazy! It’s like unicorn tears in a little tub. ~magical~",2
"I absolutely love this product! I’m on my 4th jar! It has taken the place of my foundation on every day except special occasions when I want to do to my face. I recommend it to everyone. I’m in my mid 30s and I love how it doesn’t sink into fine lines. It gives a bright natural look and hides redness. I’m about to run out and can’t find it anywhere! @Sephora, when will this be restocked?!",2
"Really nice cream, very hydrating and good for normal to dry skin.",2
"What I liked:-lightweight, no oil/residue leftover-did not irritate my skin-worked well with my skin year round-unscented/ not many “filler“ ingredients-different sizes and squeeze tube-more affordable priceOther thoughts:There’s nothing horrible I can say about this moisturizer. It is made for dry skin, but was just adequate for my skin (oily in the spring/summer, combination to oily in the fall/winter). The driest part of my face is my upper lip area, which still needed a richer moisturizer in the winter after using this. Good product for normal to oily skin, probably not best for dry.",1
"This is one of the best exfoliators that Iv ever used. You can literally feel your dead skin coming off your face! It’s amazing, I have oily and congested skin. This product has made my skin so smooth and has allowed my acne serum to Target more down and dirty acne",2
"Really love this! Its not like it does anything spectacular, but it feels really great. It doesn’t leave a tint like I thought it would, but the consistency is really great. Kind of like the oily(?) consistency of SunBum chapstick but a little thicker. Also, the blood orange smells like the Capri Blue(?) candles from Anthropologie.",2
I received this free to try and I really like it. It’s lightweight but still hydrating. It makes the skin look nice and dewy.,2
"This is just kinda alright, it’s a nice refreshing spray and feels/smells great, but doesn’t do much for your skin as a toner. Definitely prefer to use witch hazel, probably won’t purchase again",1
"I am now using Retin A which has made my skin a bit drier, highly sensitive, and causes rapid cell turnover. I can no longer use any scrub cleansers, and the lightest toner now stings. This works without scratching or burning my face.This does a wonderful and visible job at removing dead skin. I am a firm believer this works. If I do not use it for a day or two, there is definitely more dead skin rolling off. Plus, my skin is incredibly smooth after I rinse off the residue. Then, my moisturizer glides on. Lasts a long time.Only downside for some is that it can get a bit messy. Thus is a non issue for me, because it means it’s working.",2
"Great product. A little bit goes a long way. Just ordered my second tube. Takes off light makeup easily and although expensive, I think it is worth the cost.",2
I love that it’s a subtle exfoliant and not harsh. The scent is amazing and subtle as well! It left my skin feeling great!,2
"Love this oil. Use it almost daily as a replacement for my moisturizer. I’m not sure how well it sits under make up but I think it’ll work well. Keeps my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. Gives me a glow, might seem like its an oily glow at first but it sits really well on the skin. I have combo/dry-ish skin. It also makes my skin feel really soft that I catch myself touching my own face throughout the day. I do have Acne prone skin but this did not really break me out.I’ve tried a couple of other oils such as the maracuja oil from Tarte and the Cover Fx drops (i had the lemongrass one) which I really loved until sephora stopped selling it. Replaced the cover Fx one with this one. For those who do not like scented products, this doesn’t really have a scent, maybe slightly.",2
"I wanted to love this product after reading such great reviews but it’s just okay. I’ve used this for more than 5 weeks now but there’s definitely no skin improvement and I keep waiting for that clean feeling. I actually have consistent bumps under the skin all along my jawline which I didn’t before. I have fairly clear combination skin that’s not too fussy, I’ll be going back to my origins cleanser.",0
"I wanted to love this product so badly. I had been looking for a hydrating serum at a reasonable price point and tried this based on success with other Drunk Elephant products. I live in the Northeast so winters are rough on my skin (perpetually dry with flaking). I honestly feel like this made my skin worse. It felt like slight burning during my first few uses but I decided to give it more time assuming my skin needed to adjust. Nope, I feel like it made my usual winter irritation worse. Would not recommend.",0
"Great to control or prevent any blemishes. I am considering moving away from this towards a spot treatment, however, so I can use something less harsh on my skin when not necessary.",1
I love this wrinkle correcting eye cream.I can honestly see a difference in my skin.It appears stronger and visibly smoother.,2
This face wash is still my favorite after using it for 2 years. It gets my makeup off and cuts the grease. Even my husband uses it now! Its gentle enough to get eye make up off and still leaves my face feeling clean.,2
"I do not use waterproof or “long wear“ makeup, so I don’t know how well it will work on that.  But, it is one of the most effective makeup removers I have tried, and it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  Other makeup removers had me rubbing away excess mascara “racoon“ residue even after washing, but this does not.  Many people mention the smell.  I have bought both the cherry version of this and the green - both work well.  yes, the cherry smells better, but the green is nice too after a few uses.  i continue to buy this product.",2
Really love this product! Can’t give it 5 stars yet because i have only used it for about two weeks! I love how there’s barely any scent to it and my skin is definelty more soft and hydrated after using it!,1
"This works splendidly before beginning my skincare regimen and makeup. The price tag doesn’t hurt too badly either. The only down side I’ve had with this is the value size leaks almost every time I’ve opened it, which can be more than twice a day. I don’t know why this happened, but I otherwise love it.",2
"This is my second bottle of this product and I am so happy with the results. I have dry/combo skin. It usually gets pretty dry during winter, but this oil moisturize my skin really well. I mainly use it as a night time treatment. I love the fact that is all natural and works so good, it also gives my skin a beautiful glow but without a greasy look. Definitely a must have!!! I just wish it was less expensive",1
Love this product. It is refreshing and cleansing and doesn’t have a scent to it,2
So I just got this and have only used it a few times but so far I LOVE it. I am on the dryer side but I still have little breakouts here and there and my skin feels so clean and fresh and amazing!,2
"So I have dry-normal skin, but I still need to set my makeup to avoid it breaking up. With that being said, I find that using urban decay all nighter   this is the perfect combo for long lasting, luminous, and fresh looking makeup. The 2 together are a killer combo. Secondly, I like using this mist on days where I only plan on needing my makeup on for a short while and I want a fresh faced dewy look. I also like this spray for my beauty blender and to blend out my foundation and concealer and add hydration. Point is, you need it.",2
"I love using this product when my face feels ’congested’ and ’gunky’. I am one who has dry/combo skin. I do not have dry patches or flakey skin, but I find that if I don’t apply the right products to my skin, my face is left feeling dry and tight. This product does not dry out my face to the extreme. After use, I always follow up with my serum and a moisturizing cream. I also love to use this when I notice my skin forming white bumps under the skin (due to congestion) or when I have any active pimples. This helps clear up the white bumps and draw out the oil and nasty stuff from the active pimples. I probably leave this on longer than I should, but I really want to draw everything out. I find this product effective, and one that will always be in my skincare regime.",1
"LOVE LOVE LOVEIt truly showed me the importance of moisturizing, I had an obsession with another moisturizer that was working for me but then noticed I had to try something new and when I received this, I feel so in love with it! Keeps me glowing and I feel the hydration so much!! This product was sent to me courtesy of Influenster for testing purposes.",2
"I got the opportunity to try the Sunday Riley’s vitamin c serum. At first impression, I really liked the smell, it was a citrusy orange. The serum itself is very creamy and hydrating, it felt amazing on my skin. After a few days I started breaking out tho, and my skin did not feel good. Now it is starting to clear up and my skin feels a lot smoother and hydrated and there are less dark spots. I believe after continuous use, my skin should be brighter and more hydrated. I actually really did like this serum, I felt like it was very effective for me, so anyone with dry skin with dark spots, this should work amazingly for you. #complimentary #GlowLikeaCEO #CEOSerumVoxBox #sundayriley #ceoserum @Influenster @SundayRiley",2
I have especially dry and sensitive skin in winter but this stuff leaves my skin with a glowy look and it’s so convenient not having to put a ton of moisturizer on anymore. I’ll be buying again,2
I use this after my face gets really dry from my acne wash and it does a great job of moisturizing and my acne has been significantly less since I started using this alongside my regular acne regimen. I can’t speak for the decreasing of puffiness in my eyes but this does feel really good,1
"I bought this as a travel size with the Luxury Facial Oil and love it! My skin appears to be more hydrated, smoother and pores are smaller. I will be purchasing the larger size. No complaints so far!",2
"Overall I liked this product but wasn’t extremely impressed with the amount of moisture it added to my lips. Product goes on a bit gooey which I also wasn’t too fond of. However I did like that it was unscented and felt good on my sensitive, chapped lips.",1
"Love biossance! They are clean,gentle and effective!",2
"This is my new favourite HOLY GRAIL sunscreen. I’m South Asian and have seen my favourite beauty blogger Arshia Moorjani recommend this brand and it’s SPF products time and time again. I was super excited to get my hands on this through Influenster for testing purposes. The texture of this is pretty light-weight (not too creamy) and is super brown girl friendly, because it does not leave a white cast on my skin. It doesn’t make my complexion look paler, like lots of other sunscreens in the market do. It is also ocean/coral friendly and doesn’t come off easily. It looks great as a primer under makeup as well, because it leaves my skin feeling really smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin as well. I have currently been quarantined at home, but have religiously been using this sunscreen everyday, because harmful sun rays are everywhere - even if you’re spending all day inside! I plan on taking a trip to Hawaii next year, so I’m super excited that it is also Hawaii compliant. I will definitely be repurchasing this once I’m out of it!",2
"I have only use twice from the recent VIB sale purchase and I notice this whipped texture gel-cream enhances my Kiehl’s Clearly Corrective Dark Spot Solution!!!! My skin is noticeably brighter like lite from within, wow!",2
After trying several setting sprays this one is my favorite. The spray is light and the scent is very soothing. I like how it sets my make up and melting into my skin beautifully. I carry the little one for a quick refresher for my make up during the day.,2
"So great!  Love the smell, the feel, the results! Received complimentary through Influenster in exchange for review",2
"I have been hearing so much about this incredible product and how much it has improved the texture under so the eye so I knew I had to try! Thank you to Octaly and Sunday Riley I got to try it and it has been so much difference with the texture and has brought my under eye alive even with genetic dark circles! Again, Sunday Riley never misses! Always the best!",2
"I’ve never found a better lip treatment! My lips are as soft as they have ever been in my life! Tried and true, now my ride or die! ❤️",2
"I love this.  I really do.  It’s such a gentle, no fuss, no muss, doesn’t strip my face type of cleanser.   I love the scent the most.  It’s possibly my favorite cleanser.  Only gripe is the small bottle has that screw cap and well that’s just a mess waiting to happen now is it ?",1
"I am really impressed with Fresh’s Tea Elixir serum! It has simplified my routine by taking the place of multiple serums I was using. After the last 2 weeks of use, I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my overall skin clarity and hydration. I’m completely obsessed with the beautiful emerald faceted bottle!",2
"Isn’t the best HA i’ve used, but it’s ok. Feels kind of sticky and sometimes causes breakouts. If you’re looking for a good and inexpensive HA try inkey list’s. Much better feeling and i believe a bit cheaper",0
Because of all the hype I decided to try it.... it’s a below average very thin moisturizer that doesn’t have a lasting hydration if any at all. You are better off buying neutrogena hydro gel or cetaphil for a fraction of the price... the packaging is trendy and is being promoted by youtubers other than that it’s nothing special. Don’t waste your money on this there are a lot of actually good options out there.,0
"Very disappointed!  I was expecting a lip treatment because my lips are extremely dry & they crack & peel during Winter.  This didn’t do Anything to resolve the issue.  It’s just a thick lipgloss, it doesn’t help resolve peeling lips.  Such a waste of money!!",0
smells nice. dried my skin out and I broke out.,0
"This stuff is amazing! I was worried about it possibly irritating my skin as my skin is more on the sensitive side so products tend to cause me to break out pretty easily. I was pleasantly surprised how well this stuff worked for me! My skin looked so healthy and noticeably brighter. Applicstion is super simple, you just grab a cotton ball and dab some on your skin. A little goes a long way and there’s not much of a smell which is also really good since some products tend to have weird smells. Overall this is a great product and does what its supposed to!",2
A Sephora employee recommended this for me because of my sensitive skin. I absolutely love it! I use it with my clarasonic.Gives a really good clean (which cleared up my acne) without being too harsh on the skin. It doesn’t irritate my skin or cause any redness like other cleaners often did. I’ve already re-purchased once and plan to do so again!,2
"I love this product so much I purchased it full size after my tester ran out. Amazing texture, smell and love that it comes in a tube.",2
"The formula changed a few years back to the “high potency“, but I have used Nit-a-mins for about 10 years. It is hydrating, absorbs quickly and has a faint orange smell that lets you know it is time for bed. I use it year round and never feel greasy.",2
Love this product! So happy I received it from Influenster. It smells great,2
Really good cream for my dry winter days since I tend to really peel on cold weather btw I have normally oily skin.,1
Amazing! Also recommended by skincare by hyram so :),2
"I think I’m the only person who didn’t get weird burning or peeling reactions from this product. I like it, but I also am a long time retinoid and retinol user. I tried the recommendation of mixing it with the B-Hydra but I felt like it was a bit too subtle for my liking. When I pair it with the Marula oil I like this product better. I also am generous with the amount I use. My poor skin probably hates me for this but I love how smooth my skin looks the next day. Pores? Where!",1
"After using product for a couple of weeks, face is smoother and feels really clean.",1
"I really enjoyed this product.  It was a super gentle exfoliator.  I used it right after I washed my face.  It definitely left my face feeling soft and clean.  It wasn’t drying at all. It’s similar to the Farmacy New Day, which is no longer available.  This is definitely a great replacement for it.",1
I have tried this product for over a month now and would say it definitely made my skin look more healthy and also helped with the dullness. It is like a quick pick me up. Love the packaging and the style of the bottle.A bit pricy but overall recommend to the people who have dull dehydrated skin!The goodness of honey really helps!,1
Love love love this product this is my new secret weapon! I have combination skin and sometimes it’s clear sometimes it’s all broken out sometimes it’s dry sometimes it’s greasy this was the perfect fix! Can’t say enough good things about this product!,2
Love love love. Stop thinking about it. Changes your skin overnight. Perfectly formulated in every way. Gentle exfoliation at it’s finest.,2
"I received the Dermalogica daily micro exfoliant as a free full sized sample from BzzAgent. I really like this exfoliant because the beads are micro and not too big like some others that I have tried, it’s like a powder. Because of this, it is not too abrasive on the skin but gentle enough to use every day. I use it about twice a week because I also use a chemical exfoliant, and using it daily would be too much for my skin. I also love the ingredients, like salicylic acid, rice enzymes, White tea and licorice for brightening, and oatmeal and Allantoin to calm the skin. If you like a physical exfoliant and you haven’t tried the micro exfoliant, I would definitely recommend this one. I just put my daughter on to this exfoliant because she has dry skin and it’s been peeling a lot lately. One bottle lasts for months.",2
"This moisturizer is nice and light which is great for summer. I do like that it’s fragrance free, it also has a nice gel texture. I do find that for my skin I likely need a bit thicker cream but overall I liked it.",1
This smells just like caramel candies and leaves my lips sooo hydrated. It has no taste which personally is good and is 100% worth your money!! It’s personally their best lip product,2
"Overhyped. No noticeable difference, if anything made my skin feel congested. Switched back to first aid beauty and saw a marked improvement.",0
Love this stuff!!! My boyfriend even uses it! Definitely worth the money!,2
"Just 2 pumps is enough  to take off a face full of makeup, even water proof mascara! Is so good that I can see the makeup in the sink after and all that remove from my skin. Still very gentle to my skin, and the minimize my pores after. Skin feels great, clean and bright!",2
"This is hands down the best cleanser I’ve ever purchased. I have been restocking this for years and got all my friends to switch to it. It is amazing, especially for the price you pay, and doesn’t dry your skin like a lot of other cleansers. The size variety is also great - I get the big value size for my home and the mini one for travelling all the time. Don’t hesitate, buy it and you won’t regret it",2
"I have extremely dry flaky skin especially around my nose and decided to try Tarte “drink of H2O“ to see if it would give the hydration I would need. After a week of trying it, I didn’t see or feel any difference. I wouldn’t recommend it to those who have dry flaky skin like I do.",0
"This is the best make up remover/pre cleanse ever. I’ve really been trying to educate myself on skincare more and have been doing the double cleanse method. This product is very gentle, smells nice, and just melts make up away. Even waterproof makeup! The little spatula that comes with it is great for keeping bacteria from building up and measuring the right amount of balm. A little goes a long way. Will forever repurchase.",2
"If REDNESS on your face is a concern, you need this in your life!!! The SPF is a huge added bonus. You will start to rethink wearing foundation. Once the green neutalizes, you will be surprised at how great you look!",2
"I love how the packaging is simple and clean. The facial treatment essence was so light and helped clear my skin. It felt so hydrated after using it. The ingredients I could read and understand, which was nice. No strong smell to it. I would deffinently recommend to anyone trying to improve their skin.",2
Love!!!! A staple in my skincare routine. It makes my face look so glowy and healthy after using.,2
"Most cleansers dry out my sensitive skin but this one is very gentle and leaves my skin soft.I personally enjoy the scent. It is definitively artificial which is usually a turnoff for mr, but I quite like it.",2
"you have to wear this for 4-6 hours, which means you can’t wear it overnight, because most people sleep more than 6 hours a night. it’s very annoying to have on your face while conscious. when i peeled it off, it didn’t even look like it caught anything. you’re better off with a biore pore strip that only takes 8 mins",0
Tried a sample and I’m HOOKED. if you’re having doubts of trying because Of the price like I did please don’t hesitate to ask for a sample and then you’ll want to buy the full price. I have combo skin,2
Was so excited about this product! It’s probably the only exfoliator that doesn’t dry out my face but also does the job of cleansing. Would definitely recommend!!,2
"For those complaining that it just sits on the skin, try using it as an overnight mask!  The formula is like a very thick moisturizer and by allowing it to sit overnight, the mask absorbs into the skin and make your skin so soft and glowing the next morning!  This is my favorite mask ever and works so well when used after my GlamGlow mask.",2
"Great lipgloss for a clear shine, but i was looking for a moisturizing lip balm that would finally clear away my extreme chapped lips.....this is better for a nice glisten!",1
Use this stuff everyday! I love to mix it with my morning serum. Only 1-2 drops is all you need. Keeps my pale skin looking glowy all winter long,2
I love the sleek design of this product and I’ve used this for a few days and I feel like there is a difference! It makes me really happy and I’m going to continue using it! The lines under my eyes are less visible and I feel much better about my appearance!,2
I love how well this tiger grass color correction treatment covers the redness and dull spots in my complexion. In a few easy steps I get a flawless finish with my makeup routine. After cleansing and moisturizing I add my Dr. Jart color correction treatment before my primer and foundation and I do not have to worry about the redness or dull spots showing through. This product has made my life so much easier and I am loving the confidence I feel throughout my day.,2
"This cream works pretty well, but it wasn’t fully soothing. I get really itchy legs, and it helped ease the itchiness over time but it wasn’t immediately soothing. Also, I find the cream the tiniest bit sticky, but that I can deal with.",1
"I got a mini sample of this not expecting anything. It sat on my shelf for about a month until I decided to try it out. It was a pleasant surprise! It gives the slightest sheen, nothing sparkly (which I HATE sparkly glitter chunks). It smells nice and doesn’t irritate my skin either. It almost gives a blurring dewy effect. The only thing is that I’m not sure how moisturizing this is, especially for me with my very dry skin. I tend to use a better moisturizer before putting this on. Regardless, I ended up buying a real bigger size after using my sample. Love it.",1
"i dont generally have sensitive skin -- in fact, i feel like my skin doesn’t really react to products positive or negatively! i got this sample as part of a birthday gift and tried it one night. the next morning, i woke up to super itchy skin. my whole face is, like, rough, splotchy and covered with milia-esque bumps! it’s been three days and i’m still waiting for recovery. really expected better from a mild, clean, EXPENSIVE!!! product lol..",0
(I received this complimentary from Influenster for review purposes only.) I’ve been using this product for years and absorbs nicely as well. Do not apply this with with a cotton pad as it wastes the formula. It’s better to pat it directly onto your skin with your hands. This is the original SK-II essence and seems to absorb better than the rose gold packaged Ultimate Revival Essence ($305). I’ll be using this for years to come.,2
"I was excited to try this product! However, this made me break out with tiny white heads all over my face. I have normal skin so I decided to keep using it while eliminating other possible causing factors but my face got worse. I loved the ingredients but I’m confused why the terrible reaction. Also the packaging is awkward. Product kinda just farts out, sometimes causing waste. Because this product is so expensive, be very careful when trying to squeeze the hard thick plastic bottle or too much will come out.",1
"This is probably the second review about a product that I’ve ever written but that’s because I am so pleasantly surprised that this product seemingly works!? I have had genetic dark under eye circles my whole life and am one of those people who cannot go anywhere without wearing some type of concealer/makeup...I have pretty fair skin and I look like I was punched in both eyes all the time unless I pile on makeup, without it I look ill/sick...plus as a mom I am always tired so it makes it so much worse! I’ve been using this 1-2x/day for 3 weeks now and I’ve noticed they look less puffy and slightly less dark than they usually do, and my concealer seems to fall and stay better under my eyes now. Definitely recommend trying!",2
Me and my boy friend both tried it. Not working. It used to be 38 dollars. I think they decreased the price for a reason. Drug store product function better than this.,0
"I received this Complimentary gift from OLEHENRIKSEN for testing purposes. First, I would like to say that this toner smells amazing! I’m so used to toner smelling like some weird version rubbing alcohol but this smells like a cross between citrus and chamomile. As for the product, I do not suffer from dark spots so I could not tell the difference in my skin after using the product for a week. I will continue to use to see if I notice changes.",1
"Completely controls any hormonal acne that I would normally get on my chin during PMS. So hydrating, and love this product for my dry combo skin. Even better when used with the Farmacy Sleep Tight Balm.",2
"I loved DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA® EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL. However, I think the price point is just too high. If it was a little more economical, it would be a great addition to any skincare routine.",2
"I can’t explain how much I love this primer. I have combination skin and have struggled with my foundation separating. I’ve changed my foundation, concealer and press powder a million times and nothing made a difference until I started using this product. Definitely a game changer!",2
"I absolutely love this lip mask - it smells great, tastes great, and most importantly it really works! I enjoy the fact that while its meant for bed time, you can still wear it during the day. My lips instantly look hydrated and glossy PLUS this actually lasts through the night. It is smooth, thick, and feels nourishing without being sticky or greasy. I was sent this product from Influenster to review, but I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out.",2
Super effective. I recommend using only as needed. If you don’t leave some time between uses I feel like it’s not as potent.,2
"I should have looked at the ingredients before purchasing this based on the positive reviews (it’s 40% petrolatum). It feels great when applied, but it does not hydrate or heal dry lips. If your lips are in good condition and you’re only looking for protection, the petrolatum acts like a seal to hold in moisture (along with the added benefit of SPF). However, for those who need the product to sink in for added hydration like me, this product is disappointing.",0
This product is truly a life saver!!!! It is super hydrated and smell amazing. A little goes a long way. Note: I received this product complimentary for sampling purposes.,2
"When I first bought this cleanser (about 2 years ago), I thought “Oh, my gosh, $18 for a bottle of cleanser!“. But I was really tired of my face breaking out and was lured in by the name (First Aid Beauty).After I tried it and found out you don’t need to use a whole lot, I knew that I had found my forever cleanser. It works well when I use it with a cleansing brush or even using just my hands.I use it to remove all my face makeup except for eye makeup. I use something else for that. It definitely takes it all off and a toner is not needed.The smell is non-offensive, and the consistency feels really nice. The tube lasts a long time. You can’t go wrong here.",2
Love the smells and it leaves my skin soft without the white residue,2
"I suffer from hormonal acne (which have left me scars), uneven skin tone, and enlarged pores. This cleanser has been miraculous. I’ve been using it for two weeks now and the results are definitely visible. My face looks and feels really soft and healthy.",2
"If you’re expecting a thick, heavy moisturizer, this is not for you. This is a lightweight bit of moisture that absorbs really quickly. Would recommend for someone with oily skin.",1
"Good product, it helps with scarves and pimples, a must have.",2
"This is the most mediocre lip gloss/balm that I have ever used. It has a light, pleasant smell and gives a decent shine but is still lightly sticky. The quality just isn’t worth $20, in my opinion.",1
I’ve been using this every day since I received it. Super effective. The texture is amazing and feels so good on my skin. Definitely recommend! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.love,2
"I have dry skin and my under eye area is the most problematic spot for me. Last week I had serve dry spots that was on one of my eye lids and under both of my eyes, which has never happened to me before. I have been using the Ole Henriksen banana eye cream (I also have dark circles, that cream has helped me out so much with that) but it was not helping with my dry patches at all. I went to Sephora and purchased this eye cream and WOW! It took away my dry patches within three days. Also, I have really big pores under my eyes and they look so much smaller and I have been only using this eye cream for a week. The formula is exactly what I have been missing, and a little goes a long way. It’s my new fave eye cream! Will definitely be repurchasing, and if you have dry under eyes you will love it too!",2
"I thought this was very moisturizing and a lovely touch after washing my face. It feels luxurious and the packaging is beautiful. It doesn’t cause my acne prone skin to break out, which is great. I received this complimentary from Influenster to test and review.",1
"this product is extremely expensive, but it gives my skin a glow that is out of this world. BE VERY CAREFUL AROUND EYE AREA. I had a horrible reaction, but now I know (it’s not the product’s fault). I will be buying again, and it smells wonderful as well!",2
"I live in Chicago, and the terrible cold takes its toll on my skin, even when I keep it covered. After a particularly frigid week, my whole face was cracked everywhere like some comic book mutant. No amount of lotion was healing the dry patches, and no make-up could go on without highlighting the rough, sad texture of my cheeks! An enormously helpful Sephora employee recommended this product and my face healed up almost completely after 2 days of use. On day 3, and I’m almost back to normal! It moisturizes without adding a heavy, greasy, or oily feel or look, and it doesn’t clog pores or cause break-outs. I feel so relieved, and I look so much better. WHEW.",2
"I used these up over a period of about a year. I was not in love with this product since it left a sheen over my skin that felt a little sticky (it didn’t last for long, though), but I did keep coming back to it because it does as it promises, which is to exfoliate, tone, & brighten. I am still looking for a better match for me, but I did like these pads.",1
"I got this as a free sample and will need to buy it before I run out! This feels so hydrating without feeling heavy. My skin feels the softest it’s ever been, highly recommend!",2
"I received a sample of this from from Influenster.  I like This moisturizer.  I have dry skin.  I havent Noticed a boost in radiance, but it hasn’t caused any breakouts.  It has moisturized my face pretty nicely",2
"I wanted to love this so badly. Not only because it is beloved by a couple of skincare gurus I admire AND it took me three times to successfully get my hands on it. Alas, I can’t stand it. The texture is slightly gritty and doesn’t really emulsify. As many others have noted, it sits on your skin and DOES NOT WASH OFF. I have to scrub with a wet rag to not only get makeup off, but the balm itself. Trying to think of an alternative use so as not to waste the product. Shave gel?",0
"I’ve received samples in the past and decided to splurge. This mask smells and feels just so calming and luxurious. I have oily and acne prone skin, so any little thing can cause a flare. This mask provides such relief to my skin. I always feel so hydrated and refreshed after using it. Do I feel like it’s a must have? No. But I do feel like it relaxes not only my senses, but my skin, after a long week.",2
I received a sample of this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. The creme is quite rich but absorbs very quickly. It definitely kept my usually dry areas around my nose very nicely hydrated and my skin was fresh and dewy in the morning after using at night. It does have a bit of a scent but not strong enough to  linger.,2
"I loved the immediate results, which were visibly exfoliated skin, and an initial glow, but just seconds later, while i was looking for my moisturizer, my skin dried out and became so tight and flaky, it was uncomfortable. I wish it worked for me, especially since the reviews were glowing!",0
What an amazing face butter I have tried many diffrent face mosturizers but this on knocks it outta the park omg that perfect silky feeling can not be beat would recommend to anyone who loves skin care!,2
"All natural, organic, no scent, NOT GREASY!!!! Can wear under makeup. I also use it at night, after taking makeup off.",2
"I have very dry combo skin, and for the price point I had high expectations. This product glides on, and like other reviews state has a consistency almost of a shortening, but does not hydrate at all. By the morning my eyes are left feeling sunken and super dry. I drink SO much water all day. I have only started using the Tatcha products (I’m on my 2nd dewy and I still don’t know) I was a Kiehls girl for almost 12 years so this is going back. I like Bye Bye for the eyes.",0
"Received a complimentary trial size in exchange for my honest review. I really enjoyed this. Other essences and serums I’ve used have a strong scent, and I could barely detect any smell in this one. Felt light going on, and didn’t burn anywhere, even near my eyes. I feel like it balanced my skin between cleansing and moisturizing without leaving my skin overly dry, greasy, or otherwise uncomfortable. I wouldn’t say my skin is “crystal clear” after using it, I didn’t notice a huge difference in my skin’s tone or fine lines. But it feels and smells much better than a lot of toners and serums out there, and is so lightweight that I’d consider purchasing.",1
Love love love! So happy I’ve found a moisturizer I can use every night that doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I also have very dry and skin and this gives me hydrated skin throughout my day. Worth every penny!,2
"I have tried many different brands of pimple patches and this is the best of the best! Works best when applied using tweezers and worn overnight on open blemishes/spotsPROS: bumps gone overnight, reduces blemishes significantly, does not cause further inflammationCONS: very noticeable when worn so best to wear overnight, pricey but worth it!",2
"I have dry and sensitive skin. So that made my skin red, uneven and textured. Bought this yesterday with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and them paired together over 1 night made my skin so smooth. No more texture and redness. I feel super hydrated and I don’t think I will have to reapply until my night routine. Would 100% with ppl who have dry and textured skin!! And it’s such a good price!! I’m super happy, I will be a forever Ordinary user.",2
"Best eye cream I’ve used so far! It’s super hydrating and moisturizing and doesn’t irritate my eyes. I also like the packaging and the amount of product inside. I mean, for the price it’s definitely worth it since a little goes a long way. TIP: I usually place this inside the refrigerator for like an hour before I use it so it would have a cooling and refreshing feeling when applied!Note: I received this belif Moisturizing Eye Bomb product free for testing purposes from Influenster. Reviews/opinions of the product are solely my own.",2
"I used this moisturizer for a whole 6 months good texture moist and smooth, but I didn’t see any changes at all as they promised. Also, comparing  with other brands I can find cheaper alternatives with lower price",0
"This primer not only helps my makeup go on smoother, but it also moisturizes my skin. I love that because I’m all about a multifaceted product. Also, my makeup stays on a long time as well. I really love this product!",2
"I have psoriasis around my eyes and always have to keep them well hydrated, but also many moisturisers either irriate my skin, or melt into my eye and make them sting or water. This has been the only moisturizer that have I found, that makes my eyes area moisturized, and supple - which reduced the look of fine lines. Its amazing!",2
"My FAVORITE lip product. I’ll never use anything else. It smells incredible and it’s really smooth.10/10 thank you, Laneige for keeping my lips alive in this cold weather.",2
My favorite Cleansing balm!!! I definitely recommend this to people but I don’t like using this around my eyes though. My eyes are kind of sensitive,2
"This is the only primer that isn’t greasy. (and I’ve tried many of them).  I wear it alone, without foundation, often. It truly is like putting silk on my skin.",2
this product is great. keeps skin hydrated.,2
All of these people complaining about the smell need to chill. It literally has no scent at all. I had great results with this product.,2
"I took a chance on this expensive cream and it did nothing for the area under my eyes. I am mad I wasted my money!  It didn’t really moisturise the area, and it surely didn’t do a thing for my dark circles. The only cool thing about it is the bottle top and how it closes.  Don’t waste your money on this one.",0
When I first started using this I was AMAZED at how well it worked! It worked the whole time actually and I used the whole container. The only downside was that about two weeks after I started it my pores began clogging. I’ve always had a pimple here or there.. but I ended up with my face being covered like never before.,1
"I am very new to the Ordinary products line, but and am very pleasantly surprised with the results I have received for such a great price! I use this Glycolic Acid before I begin my nightly skin routine. I have already noticed a difference in my skin texture and overall look",2
I received this product from influenster and I love it. The smell and texture is nice but I wish it was just a tad more thick. This is great for the summer months!,1
"I’ve only used this at night, and it works really well for combination skin. My nose is riddled with blackheads and the morning after using, they aren’t as visible (still there) but not as extreme. The smell and appearance remind me of a mask so it kind of freaks me out every time before applying. No residue and it doesn’t seem so pill on face with other products",1
"Protects my skin, leaves a nice satin/slightly dewy finish, long lasting and doesn’t easily rub off. The thing that keeps this from being a 5 star product for me, is that it feels greasy going on and I can feel a light film on my face. I used this on my bare face with no other products so I cannot speak to how it does with makeup.",1
This moisturizer is something else! So light weight and I can feel the hydration right away! My skin gets really dry on cold months and this is really helping it! I can really feel my skin absorbing it! Definitely recommend it!,2
"I know this product is wayyyy too expensive. BUT OMG IS IT FABULOUSSSSS. I absolutely love this moisturizer, I personally think it is definitely worth the price. I get such dry skin sometimes, especially because I suffer from bad acne so a lot do the products I use to keep it under control makes my skin very dry. I also found out that dry skin doesn’t make acne go away, your skin should be moisturized and that’s exactly what this cream does. It does NOT make me look oily or sticky, it isn’t heavy on your face. It makes you GLOW and feel amazing. I would definitely recommend this product, it became my favorite step in my skin routine .",1
I received this product to review from Influenster. I am hooked on this moisturizer. It is not too heavy and gets the job done. Love that the scent is subtle & not overpowering. Will definitely keep this product in my daily skincare routine!,2
"Wow this works great!! I use it while I’m in the shower, leaves my face feeling nice and smooth! Very easy to use, everyone needs this! I feel like my face is glowing!",2
I have to say I was really impressed with this serum they gave my face a really smooth look and didn’t have a strong fragrance smell at all which I like. Even though it was just the seven day Even though it was just 87 day face serum it worked really well with my skin. It didn’t dry out my face or cause any breakout. I highly recommend this product. It really helps smooth out your face.,2
"Perfect for my sensitive skin, affordable, it actually does work and does wonders for my skin. Super easy to apply and easy to wash off. It’s very concentrated so you don’t need too much. This product will last you a long time!",2
"This is one of the first Drunk Elephant products I have tried, and I’m truly impressed. It’s moisturizing enough that when applied at bedtime, my skin will still feel soft and plumped in the morning. When applied in the morning, it moisturizes without leaving my skin feeling greasy. I apply sunscreen over it and I haven’t had any issues with pilling and my makeup goes on nicely over both.",2
"It has a nice light consistency and absorbs fairly quickly as you gently massage into your skin. When thoroughly absorbed it leaves no sticky or oily after residue. A single use left my face feeling softer, smoother and hydrated with zero irritation. It’s packed with incredible ingredients and works for all skin types/tones including my sensitive skin. Its fragrance-free, allergy tested, oil-free, SLS-free, SLES-free, sulfates-free, free of denatured alcohol. I would definitely want to try full-size to see more noticeable results over a longer period of use. Thanks #trywithtopbox and @cliniquecanada for the #freeproduct",1
"It’s so  hard to find to find moisturizer that is not oily nor dry, just the right texture. I find that it works for different ethinicities , different ages, and different skin types. I will forever swear by it",2
"Works so well on my sensitive skin, haven’t used it long enough to see about acne spots though",1
this is the best cleansing oil I’ve ever used!! I use it after I take a makeup wipe to my face because the wipe never takes it all off. I use it morning and night followed by the rice enzyme powder and the two leave my face feeling so clean and fresh!,2
"I really do like this night cream and I find myself going back to it over all my other products. Origins is a good brand and their products have never made me break out, which is common when I try skincare. It’s very moisturizing but doesn’t leave my skin feeling oily or greasy at all. The only reason it isn’t five stars is because I find that it’s pretty thick and not the easiest to apply. Nevertheless, I’ll probably repurchase this cream since I’m always happy with the results. A little goes a long way!",1
"This worked WAY better than expected. Baby soft lips without the excess peeling or feeling of dry lips after it is rubbed off. Will LITERALLY, only purchase this for my gym bag.",2
I. Freakin. Love. This. I can honestly tell a big difference when I use this product. It clears the large pores on my chin better than any other product I’ve tried and leaves my skin looking bright and moisturized. I love the consistency as well- feels like a light lotion. You can feel it starting to work almost immediately but it’s not uncomfortable. The packaging is very beautiful as well as functional. Definitely my favorite skin care product!,2
"I bought this product for the good reviews and I guess I wasn’t disappointed. But, I don’t see much difference from it. Similar effect of just having vaseline on your lips- it does the job.",1
My Husband will actually use this product and he is picky picky! He has extremely dry skin and it keeps him hydrated!,2
Awesome!!  I received this in a play box and I have to say I thought that it was just hype for all the rave reviews.  I used it more specifically for my undereye area which is really prone to be dry and has fine lines. I usually dont wear concealer because it creases so bad.  I always use undereye creams to moisturize but it never helps.  I used this and it helped smooth everything out!  The lines are not gone by any means but at least it doesnt look so dry.  My makeup on top doesn’t crease as badly so my undereye area looks better.  I feel like this will help improve skin over time so I will definately keep using and will probably purchase again.,2
"First impressions I loved it. Felt good on the skin, covered my redness and it felt moisturized. The only reason it’s not getting a full five stars is because I wear contacts and when I applied it, I applied it everywhere including my eyelids. I must have gotten some in my eyes, which it didn’t burn or anything because I didn’t realize I had done it but it got on my contacts and I could not clean it off of them. I had blurry vision and had to open up new contacts. The smell isn’t the greatest either but that doesn’t usually matter to me.",1
This product is amazing I love it to you race all of my make up off of my face.,2
I liked the way that it felt going on and I liked that it’s in an easy to carry.  Unfortunately I didn’t see any results with this.,1
This is soooo luxurious I LOVE IT! Rich without being too heavy. I checked the ingredients prior to using to make sure there wasn’t anything that could possible clog my pores and was super impressed there wasn’t given how hydrated and rich it feels.,2
Really like this! Works well and lasts a while. Also smells decent,2
this is the best makeup remover ive ever used. it gets every bit of mascara and liquid lipstick off without a struggle,2
While is is very moisturizing I can not get used to the smell,0
Smells amazing but not enough hydration for me. I would suggest this for someone who is very oily!,0
Obsessed with this exfoliator! I use this about 1-2x per week and it always leaves my skin glowing and smooth as butter. I highly recommend!,2
"i adore this! it’s the best moisturizer i’ve ever used, hands down. i do musical theatre and dance, so i wear a lot of heavy makeup, and after a performance this is the perfect thing for my abused skin. it can be a little bit heavy, but when it’s used sparingly, it also makes a great everyday moisturizer. absolutely worth every dollar i paid for it. the only improvement that could be made would be adding more spf.",2
"This is a holy grail product for me! It has cleared up my acne and scarring. Leaves my face glowing and hydrated. I was nervous at first to use an oil bc I have combo skin, but wow it is amazing. It’s a dry oil so doesn’t leave your face feeling greasy. I use this as my night time moisturizer and it has seriously changed my skin. Also, love the price point!",2
I was able to try Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare and I loved it. It was so quick and easy to use. I could feel it working right away. I noticed a difference in just a short time of using. Thanks Pinchme.,2
"I want to love this so badly but like another reviewer said, it smells heavily of standard sunscreen smell =(  The watermelon smell is so light compared to the sunscreen smell. I wouldn’t mind if it smelled like sunscreen, except you can smell it all day and it’s worse when you have to wear a mask.Otherwise, I love the texture and and how light it is, with no whitecast. Gives off the perfect dewy finish. Haven’t tried it under makeup, but it’s great for a natural look.Unfortunately I will be returning due to the smell.",1
"This product has been a life saver! I have combination skin, but lean more towards the oily side for my T zone. Before going to bed I put this on along with my face oil and wake up with soft and hydrated skin (not oily). I then apply it after showering in the morning regardless if I’m wearing makeup or not.",2
"This is the greatest moisturizer, especially for combination skin! it is so light weight and does not clog my pores or make my skin greasy!",2
I use this at night after washing my face and it has helped balance my skin incredibly. Keeps my skin from producing excess oil throughout the day. Love it!,2
"This product is really nice and very hydrating/moisturizing. My skin glows, looks nourished and plush, and feels soft. I wish it got rid of my dry red bumps I have on the tops of my cheek bones, but it only just reduced them. I don’t know if this provides any long term effects. I used it for a solid month or more, and I didn’t notice any improvement in the condition of my skin when I removed the cream.",1
"I have combination skin and use this face cream every morning and night, along with using origins charcoal mask once a week. My face has never been softer or brighter! I get so many compliments on my complexion. INLOVE!!!",2
This mask is has been great during this cold dry winter season. I have very sensitive skin and this is gentle enough and see immediate results after using it. Sometimes when my body is dehydrated it def shows in my face and around my eyes & I’ll apply this mask and leave on overnight focusing around my eyes & forehead.  When I wake up my skin is hydrated and brighter!,2
Favourite! I have somewhat sensitive skin and this product didn’t irritate it at all. Cleans well but doesn’t leave your skin feeling dry. Would definitely recommend,2
"this is so amazing. it cleared up all my little bumps on my chin, forehead, and nose. i washed my face with this and then used grape seed oil for my moisturizer and omg, better that anything I’ve ever tried before. ive never really had acne but I’ve have a few hormonal colorless bumps in the most oily parts of my face and it took me a year until I found this until it finally was smooth and clear. BLESS THIS",2
I have sensitive skin that hates most products but this scrub is gentle enough to not cause my skin to be bothered. I like the citrus scent of it as well! It is great to use in the mornings to wake you up. I was given this product for free for a review.,2
I was one of the lucky ppl that influencers send a box with this rosy clay mask so I can sample it. I feel in love with this mask it was so thick and heavy and it stay on face. It didn’t smell and it a rich grey color. I really like that after I applied it my face felt more clean and fresh. I also like to say that I would recommend this mask because I love taking care of my skin. Specially if you have big pores like me I would say try this product works.,2
"I love Korres products and this one delivers! Thick, creamy texture and not oily at all. Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean.",2
"Not great if you have acne prone and sensitive skin. These irritated my skin because they’re so strong, and my skin was so dried out from them that my hands were peeling (even after only being in contact for a few seconds)! They don’t seem to have done much for me and I keep trying to make them work but it’s not worth the effort.",0
"I bought a Josie Maran sampler with a small jar of this in it. I will definitely be buying the full size when I run out. I put this on before bed and wake up with skin that looks refreshed. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. I’m not a fan of the regular argan oil, but this and the daily moisturizer w SPF in it are just great.My skin is normal, not dry or oily.",2
"This mask deserves all the hype and more. My skin feels instantly tighter and with little irritation. Be generous and use two pumps, making sure to fully massage it in until the crème turns completely white, then leave on for the full 15 minutes.It’s worth every penny, for sure!",2
"Great product! When I first tried it, it did sting but after the second use it stopped. Unfortunately I have been on and off with using this product but I think it has helped my skin for the most part",2
I was pretty impressed to see how smooth and radiant my skin looks and feels after using this dermalogica daily microfoliant faithfully.  I was worried it would be too much to use every day but it is not. My skin feels so soft. I am kind of obsessed with this particular multi-ingredient rice powder formula because it is gentle but really effective. Even my make up goes on smoother. I got so many compliments from friends and family at the holiday parties last month so I know it’s apparent. My skin actually looks brighter and more radiant even without makeup. This is easy to incorporate into my every day skin care regimen so I will continue to use it.,2
"My face typically adapts to facial cleansers and I thought that this would be a really good one but ever since I started using it which was 2 weeks ago, my face has been itching me nonstop and has turned completely red. Wouldn’t recommend this facial cleanser to anyone.... not for everyone and definitely feels like a cheap facial cleanser....",0
Wish I had bought it years ago. Got all my makeup (including glittery eyeshadow) off in one try,2
I would not waste my money on this product ever again. Irritated/burned my skin each time I applied. I did not notice any improvement in my skin once the irritation calmed down.,0
Best hydrating mask at a great price. Just leave it on overnight and you’ll wake up looking so much more hydrated.,2
"After reading reviews on every face cleanser on the Sephora site I decided to try this. I switched from the Purity cleanser and have ZERO regrets. This cleanser leaves your face feeling so clean without irritation. The acne and redness I had from my previous cleanser was gone after 2 washes, and my pores are visibly reduced. I have very dry, sensitive skin and have had no issues with this at all, which is a breath of fresh air. I cannot recommend this enough! BUY THIS.",2
love it. the consistency is really thick and does not leaving you looking all shiny and oily. it is odorless and amazing,2
"I need a reef safe sunscreen for an upcoming trip and purchased this since the product description literally claims it falls into this category. I just found out that the active SPF ingredients in this are actually not environmentally safe for marine life and are on a banned list for the tour I’m taking, so avoid this product and it’s active ingredients if reef safe is important to you.",0
"This stuff soothes and heals better than any lotions, corticosteroids, or salicylic acid creams I’ve ever tried, and as a bonus, it isn’t even greasy. I’ve had both psoriasis and eczema my entire life, and don’t expect anything to cure them, but this ultra-repair cream comes close! Small patches cleared up after only a few days, and big, cracked, persistent patches look better, feel softer, and itch much less.  It smells a little bit herbal-medicinal, but it works so well, I don’t even care. Please, please, please never discontinue this product.",2
"This is a wonderful moisturizer. It’s thick, rich and creamy but doesn’t leave your skin feeling oily or greasy. It’s the perfect base for makeup because it really plumps up your skin and makes foundation sit beautifully on the skin. Highly recommend!",2
Sunday Riley is amazing!! I have literally tried everything and nothing compares to this. Just buy it buy all her stuff it’s all good,2
"I was first introduced to this product by an associate at Sephora several years ago. I was looking for Anti-Aging skin care as I had hit my “40 is the new 30“ age. Since using the product and investing in a Clarisonic (a must as well) my skin has never looked better. I receive so many compliments on my skin even from my 20 & 30 something friends. Lately, I have been in search for a less expensive face wash. I keep reading in all the magazines and hearing from various skin care experts that you should be putting your money into things like serums. In my search, I have been battling breakouts constantly even when it’s not that time. I am back to this cleanser and will stay!",2
"Huda beauty has being working for a year for this product to be released, i have oily skin, open pores, small pimples, when i received it i said great!! Lets see what wonders do on my face, first day since this day i could say this is a soft scrub face, i use it daily, their recommendations is to use it once or twice a week, i have notice my complexion more brighten, it has smoothen and tighten my pores areas just as 3 to 4 days, even my makeup looks fresh and clean, where i got small pimples it mature in two days, also this product is made of fruits the best exfoliators like papaya and pineapple enzymes, and other ingredients, has a very light smell is pleasant it desappears less that a minute, also when i apply it with my clean face i can notice how this scrub activate the circulation flow of my face it turns red thats a plus for me it means is working,  also alot of impurities along with the product comes off in the first day, yes it works, is a soft scrub face.",2
Very Moisturizing and the Best Face Mask ever!!,2
This cleanser is really nice. I found that I would remove my makeup without being harsh and drying. I also like that it isn’t perfume-y. My only complaint is it doesn’t suds up well if I try to use it with a Clarisonic brush.,1
While this product does ok to rid my face of makeup it leaves a residue and film. It also bothers my eyes a ton. I tried to give it a good go seeing how many great reviews it gets but it just didn’t work out for me personally.,0
"I’ve been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now. At first, I was put off by the fragrance, but I got used to it. It’s definitely not for anyone who is sensitive to fragrances. I really don’t understand why facial products need to smell like perfume. That’s what perfume is for!This product is light weight, but still does a pretty good job of moisturizing. I’m convinced my makeup goes on smoother when I use this (I don’t use primer often). That said, I haven’t noticed any other differences with the use of this product. My skin doesn’t appear any less stressed than it was before I started using this, and haven’t really found anything zen about the experience. Overall, I’d say it’s not a bad product, but it’s not stellar either. If you’re looking for a light-weight moisturizer, then I say go for it! If you’re looking for a fragrance-free zen experience that gives you a great glow, you might want to look elsewhere.",1
I’m reordering rn as I just reached the bottom of my first full size. I got a deluxe sample of this a couple of years ago and loved it - kept stubbornly trying other eye creams for some reason but none of them did as much for me as this. So I finally decided to give in and buy the full size a couple months ago. No regrets! It feels delicious going on and it makes my eye area brighter and definitely helps keep away the crows feet. It is a little spend but lasted a long time even though I often use too much.,2
This face butter has changed my skin! I love all Josie Maran products but this one is amazing! My skin is so soft and hydrated! Paired with Argan Oil and it’s perfect!,2
"These are working great for me. I have oily and acne-prone skin, but I’m also becoming worried about aging and the development of fine lines. I’ve been using the pads for about three weeks and they seem to be bringing out newer, fresher skin for me. Blackheads are coming to the surface and clearing up. My blemishes are reduced and seem to clear up much more quickly.The pads make my skin a little tingly (some might consider it stinging, but I’m in the “if I can’t feel it, it’s not working“ camp.) I find it refreshing and I love the peachy smell. My husband even thought it smelled good!I’m totally devoted now. Thank you, Peter Thomas Roth, for making a product that addresses both oily, acne-prone skin and the early signs of aging. I’m back to purchase my second set of these.",2
"So I got this to try out in one of my Vox boxes. After 2 weeks of using it my face started to break out. I stopped waited for it to clear up, tried it again thinking it might have been my face wash. Nope my chin broke out AGAIN  plus it made my face super oily. I only used one pump of it because it’s really runny. Not worth my face breaking out.",0
"The texture of this cleanser is so so so wonderful. Had such a great lather, super light, and doesn’t leave your skin feeling stripped at all. However, after trying a sample size of this for about a week, I started breaking out in places I never do. This being the only new thing I was trying, I decided to check the ingredients to discover it had a form of coconut oil in it. Like many people, I can’t use anything with any sort of coconut oil in it if I want to maintain any sort of clear skin. So just a warning, if you can’t do coconut oil, avoid this guy. <\3",1
"Got this as a sample for 250 point and I absolutely hate it the texture is horrible it’s almost like liquid gum it dries instantly but leaves a layer on your face that prevents the skin from BREATHING about 7 hours later when I washed my face I could clearly feel the layer of this almost glue washing off, it didn’t soak whatsoever but gave an ARTIFICIAL sense of smooth skin I honestly hated this product so much I threw out the sample after less then a week it also clogged my pores and caused new break outs. Overall do not buy do yourself a favor and save some more for a real quality product, only upside it smells alright.",0
This removes the dirty out and leaves me fresh. I love how it smells and i have sensitive skin and doesn’t irritate my face :) I don’t use my hands but when i do it works just fine too:0,2
I received this cleansing oil complimentary from Dermalogica. I have been using this for the past few days and it has performed very well to remove makeup at the end of my day. This easily removes all of my makeup and leaves my skin feeling nicely cleansed. I am experiencing skin sensitivities but using this once a day didn’t seem to aggravate my skin issues. For my this is pricey for a cleansing oil but overall it performs very well.,1
Amazing product!!!! So easy to use and so refreshing. I always look forward to this step of my skin care routine!,2
The cleansing balm I always come back to. I try other cleansing balms and none of them remove my makeup and rinse as cleanly as this one! Plus it’s not irritating on my sensitive skin.,2
I don’t think I will ever stop buying this product. I apply it each night and wake up with product still on my lips in the morning. It’s super hydrating and amazing!,2
This has been the most amazing face mask I have ever tried and I suspect that it will replace all other masks in my collection. It is amazing for my sensitive skin. I love how it leaves my skin so hydrated and even seems to gently exfoliate when I wipe it off. I love that it goes on almost clear and that it is so user friendly but so effective. I have been taking this everywhere with me and using it almost on a daily basis. I have to say this is my all time top holy Grail product.,2
"I like the texture and weight of this moisturizer. It doesn’t feel too thick and greasy and not watery at all. I think it might be greasy for someone with very oil skin though. There’s no dramatic change in my skin and wrinkles but it does look less dehydrated. That being said, I don’t expect any product to erase irreversible damage. The worst thing about this is the scent. Maybe someone with a less sensitive nose can handle it, but I have to hold my breath while applying it. It smells like something sour and animal fat. I might not repurchase bc of the scent and because there’s many other moisturizers to try. I won’t toss it though bc I do think it works decently well and hasn’t caused any breakouts.",1
gifted by Dermalogica. I really enjoyed this product! It’s a great daily exfoliator because it isn’t harsh at all. I also feel that it is great for sensitive skin. It’s almost unscented there is no fragrance. The smell is a very faint smell of rice which is what it is made from. I’ve never had a powdered exfoliator before but I loved it! A little pea size amount goes a long way. I use this in the shower and just lather it together and apply it to my face. The formula is very nice and smooth. The only reason I marked it down a star is because it did dry out my face a little bit on one occasion so I just gave my face a break from it the next day and I was fine. I experienced a horrible breakout prior to receiving this due to stress and this definitely helped!,2
"Another super lip balm from the Rosebud stable. It has a zingy mint scent which perks me up when I use it and a nice natural pink colour for low maintenance lips.The ultimate for me is still the original Rosebud salve, but for this great price; why not buy a tin anyway?! Perfect gift price and retro appeal makes it a must for anyone’s shopping list!",1
"I was given a free sample in exchange for a review of the product and since the sample was enough for just 2 applications this is what I CAN confirm:It does not have a strong fragrance, nor a bad one.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not at all oily.  It sits well under makeup. Things I can NOT confirm:Whether it firms, lifts,  or provides added radiance. To be fair I never expect results after just 2 applications so I’m not saying it won’t do these things, simply that I can not determine that with what I was given.",1
"This water is very moisturizing. I usually use an oil and like this. It has a bit of a smell that I like however some might not. Depending on how much you apply, to much it will a bit of a sticky feeling on the face. I would use this again.",1
I gave this moisturizer a try beginning of Dec when my skin was a dry wreck and it started making my skin feel moisturized and soft overnight! Definitely going to become my staple winter moisturizer now.,2
Love the Drunk Elephant line and bought this after reading about how moisturizing it is. It’s pretty good and my skin seemed to stay hydrated but I wasn’t wowed overall. Going to try something different next time.,1
"What can I say this product is great all around and lasts forever. It will take off EVERYTHING in a breeze including matte lipsticks, waterproof makeup, etc. Having a double cleanse routine is crucial to keeping my pores in check and this does the job!",2
amazing product!!! look up the benefits of hyaluronic acid if you don’t know. works great as a primer too! I use this every morning before my moisturizer. this is my second bottle and I will always use it! can’t find a better product and for the price! HIGHLY RECOMMEND,2
I use this on my hands during the winter months but the unpleasant smell is so pungent I will not repurchase.,0
"I really like how lightweight this product is. It feels like I have nothing on and keeps me dewy and moisturized throughout the day. There’s also no white cast when you put it on. My only problem with this product is the smell. Does it smell great? Yes. But do we really need fragrance in our sunscreen? Not really. The fragrance just doesn’t add anything to the product; in fact, it takes away from some of the other great ingredients. I have seen other reviews that say the sunscreen burned their eyes but this did not happen for me. I applied a generous amount and it also did not peel for me. Overall, I do quite like this product and will continue to use it.",1
"Very nice product, soaks in and adds in that moisture back to skin, great for dry skin.  A little sticky, however didn’t notice any real difference to my skin.",1
A godsend. Its so hard for me to find a good moisturizer for my combo and super picky/sensitive skin. Will definitely repurchase,2
I love this serum so much! I was skeptical at first about using this because many serums cause my skin to look red and irritated but this one didn’t! It made my skin look so nice and glowy as if I just walked out of a facial ! I recommend !!!,2
"I, personally, was not able to use this every day. Very drying, ended up having cracks and flaky skin, even after applying moisturizer. I normally have very oily skin, so this was very surprising to me that it dried me out so quickly! I use it about 1-2 times a week and that seems to be working the best. Clear and soft skin!",1
Feel like I must be missing something with this product. I’ve been using it consistently with a couple breaks and noticed no difference in any way. I’m not looking for miracles but just a hint of efficacy. Maybe it’s for the long game? Probably won’t repurchase.,0
I love this sunscreen! I love the glow in it and the fact that it has spf 40 is even better! It gives your skin a glow if you don’t want to wear makeup in the heat or i wear it before i use primer and works just great!,2
I received a deluxe sample of this product and upon the first use I knew this was an HG product.  After washing and toning my face I had bright red splotches and a few pimples trying to come out.  I put this mask on.. after 20 min waiting and washing it off....NO redness...Pimple went on vacay!!! amazing :-),2
Great to use in conjunction with regular night time skincare routine. I use it on both glycolic and retinol nights and always wake up with a glow.,2
"Bought this when I was in the states and finally came round to using it once i’d finished my creams. I mix 2 drops of this with my drunk elephant gel at night and apply it to my skin  and it sinks in so nicely, sometimes i’ll get oily on  my forehead by the  morning but it does not clog pores at all so i don’t care, it’s helping fade breakout marks. When it gets cooler i’m going to add it in my morning routine also!",2
I lucked into this product - 100% Pure Argan Oil - when trying to look up another face oil I had been using. The oil is wonderful on my skin - absorbs quickly - but i still blot it before putting on mineral make-up so it doesn’t streak. I have combination skin but it seems to even out my whole face. Just an excellent product.,2
"Almost $50 for face wash that smells like dish soap is a bit much. It’s not too harsh or anything but I don’t know why it’s so popular on YouTube. I like how it came with a pump and a separate lid which is ideal for moving/travel (only the large size does, small one doesn’t). I wouldn’t buy this again though.",0
This was a nice lightweight sunscreen thats white cast didn’t last too long. I also liked that it didn’t make my oily skin feel too oily after applying which can be an issue with sunscreens. It kept my face sunburn free! I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,1
"This is my new holy grail primer! It’s got a nice luscious consistency...it’s somehow rich and thick yet non greasy and light on the skin. It’s a great alternative to the Marc Jacobs coconut primer. I also have tried many other “glotions“ and glowing primers / moisturizers and this ones much different in that it doesn’t contain shimmers or crazy looking glittery frost. It’s just atotally natural glow, zero shimmer!",2
"So I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I gave it a full month before reviewing. I have a pretty regimented skin care routine to begin with, and though this was a nice product to use I probably would not go out of my way to pick this up over what I already use. I didn’t see any real differences in my skin, and I’m not fond of skin care products that are scented.",1
As someone with acne prone skin I like that this one doesn’t break me out but tbh it’s not very hydrating. And I have to mix it with squalene oil in order to make the consistency less thick and easier to spread. Overall it’s just ok.,1
This product was gifted by Algenist. I absolutely love that this has a new pump packaging because it’s so much more user friendly than the dropper style. It dispenses a perfect amount as well. After using this serum I have noticed that my skin seems to be a bit more glowy and plumped. I haven’t noticed a huge reduction in my fine lines but I do feel like the plumping effect has helped them look not as noticeable on my forehead. One thing I don’t like about this serum is the feel on my skin. I have normal/combo oily skin and I feel like this leaves a bit of a lightly sticky feel that goes away after about 30 minutes but leaves my skin feeling more oily after the fact.  It’s not a huge deal and definitely not enough to keep me from using it because I think the benefits outweigh the cons but it is something to note if you do already have quite oily skin this may leave you more oily than you’d like.,1
Just tried this product tonight and I have to say I’m really enjoying it! The smell is earthy and not overpowering! I have really sensitive skin and this  doesn’t burn my face at all! I love that the packing is glass and has a pump. Not to mention it comes with a very good amount of product.,2
"I already got my full size, I can’t get enough of it! <3. It covers yet it doesn’t feel heavy and protects you from the sun, does it get any better than that?",2
This is actually magic in a bottle. I bought the mini because I didn’t want to fully commit to a new cleanser right away and this product is heavenly! You only need a small amount and it feels super refreshing. I’ve been using it daily for three months and I still have product left! It also comes in a small glass bottle that’s perfect for recycling for other products in the future.,2
Didn’t do much for me. No visible difference in my skin.,0
"I was excited to use this cleanser as other Drunk Elephant products have positively changed my skin so much. I used it for about two months. Somewhere around the month mark I started getting these huge, cystic pimples. I’m a 30 year old and haven’t had pimples like this since I was a teen! I assumed it was from wearing a mask (covid) so I continued using this cleanser. The pimples got worse and eventually I tried cutting out the jelly cleanser. Turns out that’s what it was! I’m really disappointed. I have sensitive skin that’s prone to dryness so someone without might not have the same problem. The cleanser itself feels really nice to use, lathers nicely and leaves your face feeling really clean.",1
"This stuff feels amazing and smells great, but like other people have said it also made me break out. I don’t know why because it’s geared towards oiler and breakout prone skin types, but as soon as I stopped using it the breakouts calmed down.",0
"I LOVE THIS CLEANSER!!! It hasn’t made me break out and it leaves my skin feeling super smooth. I’d recommend pairing this with the night mask... you’ll wake up with baby soft skin!! I usually have issues with oil and acne, but this cleanser has helped TREMENDOUSLY!!!",2
"I am a 37 year old female, who has a dry skin with aging, finelines and  wrinkles as a basic concern. This moisturizer not only hydrates my skin but brings a nice youthful glow which is always a win win. It has no sticky after feel, and absorbs into the skin very well. Do give this product  a chance in your home care, and you won’t be disappointed.",2
"I received this product complimentary from influenster for my honest opinion. I love everything about this, from the beautiful packaging to the scent of the formula. Not an overwhelming scent and the texture is smooth and silky. Leaves me skin feeling moisturized and soft. I enjoy the fresh clean feeling of this formula and it doesn’t feel thick or heavy. Leaves my skin glow. I can’t wait to see how nice it leaves my skin with longer use.",1
"This sunscreen is super light and pleasant, lightly scented but nothing too crazy. It makes me look a little oily at first, but sinks in pretty quickly and then just leaves a nice radiance. Overall a good choice and provides good protection from the sun. I haven’t experienced any sensitivity so far, although my skin is a bit unpredictable. I’d recommend for anyone to try it though!",1
This is is a great cleaner if you have dry skin and don’t wear a lot of makeup. I have normal skin that’s slightly dry in some areas and slightly oily in others and I just didn’t feel this cleanser did much of anything for me. It just didn’t make me feel clean and like all my makeup was off my face.,1
"Love this cleanser! I’ve got super dry skin and it doesn’t feel over stripped! The one thing from being 5 stars is the scent! But I love love love this cleanser!! It was originally recommended by Hyram from YouTube, and out of stock for the longest time too! So glad it came back",1
The jar is not even half full. Do not waste your money on this!! I’m so disappointed 🙁,0
"I love the way this smells. Usually face wash does one of two things: works or smells nice. This one thus far seems to be both. I have found that this works best at the end of my shower when I’ve had a chance to steam my pores. I use about the size of a dime and just buff my face for about 30 seconds or so then rinse in warm water. I have a blackhead issue and this has been the best so far to help with that. I like that my skin gets clean, I get to enjoy the smell and my issue of large pores around the middle of my face seems to be going away. And the bottle is easy to squeeze to get the product out. Note: when bottle is closed, flip over and tap the top on palm of hand. Then unscrew top, squeeze bottle a little and you will get your dime sized portion that you need. Replace cap. Voila!",2
"this trash, made my lips so DRY!!! i expected a lot and it was garbage",0
This product doesn’t do anything for my skin. Doesn’t feel like  I even moisturized once it settles in. Waste of money.,0
"Placed an order and got the trial size so I have been able to use the little sample for almost 3 weeks. I stick to drugstore/Cerave moisturizer because I have acne prone skin and moisturizers tend to break me out and I like to keep it simple when it comes to this step since I already have essences and serums that do the heavy lifting. Well this moisturizer definitely impressed me and it has been added to my wishlist for future purchase. I have oily/combo skin that can get just a little dry in the winter so this gel-cream consistency has really worked for me both day and night. I also don’t think this will be a problem during the summer time because it is light but nourishing. It goes on with a nice healthy glow but this does go away after a few seconds. My sample didn’t have any scent but I do see that it has a bunch of extracts and parfum on the ingredients list so the fact that some reviews have said it smells good makes me a little wary as I don’t use skincare with fragrance. One more thing, it hasn’t done anything for me other than moisturize me so I wouldn’t pay full price, there isn’t anything too special about it but during a sale, I’ll make sure to grab it!",2
Feels very nice and fresh when using. Hopefully it clears up some of my back break outs.,1
"I don’t even know where to start on how Fantastic this essence is. I bought the 7.2 oz bottle maybe a year ago, I used it for a few days thinking hm, just seems like water & went onto something else & I kind of forgot about it.Well, a few months ago I decided to give it a try since I paid so much for this fancy stuff. I have used it every day, morning & night & I Can.Not.Believe. how great my skin looks. II have a beautiful angelic glow, like im lit from within. No joke. My skin is smooth, pores almost Non-Existant. I haven’t had any breakouts & it has lightened existing blemish scars & what really blows me away is my horizontal forehead lines are softening up so much that they’re 95% gone. I couldn’t even get that with high grade Retin A products. Blown.Away.My advise to those that might pass this off as glorified water is to try it for a month & see where it gets you. I just can’t believe these results. I am so pleased.How I use Facial treatment essence:- First I use my clarisonic pro with the delicate brush head & cleanse with Philosophy purity made simple.- Then toner- I use Lancome tonique confort.-* Then comes the essence- I shake some into the palm of my hand, rub together & then I pat & push it into my skin. I feel that using a cotton swab will absorb the Pitera, thats a waste.Now this may sound silly, but theres Pitera soaked into your palms so I cup cold water into my hands and I run my hands up and down my arms and around the back of my neck & they have a beautiful glow too. Give it a try.Then I just follow up with a moisturizer, either ole henriksen or philosophy.After I run out of my 7 oz bottle im going to get the 11 oz, it’s a much better deal & it won’t just sit around this time.my skin went from ma’am to Miss.",2
"I normally love the Belif brand, and vitamin C so I was expecting this to be a dream come true for my dry skin… but to no avail. I found myself reaching for more moisturizers to layer on top of this one because the texture was so light. Don’t get me wrong- I LOVED the light, refreshing lemon scent, and I thought my skin did look “glowy” after a few tries… but I just felt like the moisture wasn’t penetrating into my skin. I would still recommend trying if you have combination skin though!",1
Wonderful toner! My pores do appear tighter and my skin seems over all more hydrated. It smells a little herbal but that doesn’t bother me.,2
Really happy with this and the little blue moisturizer it comes with. I’ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin,2
"I like this, especially the airtight pump jar. I’ll use until I find something better, but for now, it’s the one I keep coming back to. I’m going on faith that it’s firming my skin in the long run - but I honestly can’t tell.",1
This is a great product for anyone with dry skin! It’s literally a burst of hydration that lasts all day!,2
"I haven’t been using it too long (about a month, a few times a week), but it does brighten and tighten the pores short term. It seems like over time it softens the pores so extraction is easier. The price is a bit steep. Over the month, it hasn’t done much on the pore size etc. I wouldn’t really buy this again.",1
"I really don’t think this did anything. I was excited to try this based on reviews- which now we all know were fake. Really wish Sephora would offer a refund to all that purchased this brand. I gave away the oil and never use the other. If you want a good oil, get La Mer.",0
"Really helped with redness, but made me break out badly. My skin did NOT like this, which is a shame because it was nice not to put on makeup but still look put together.",0
"I love this cleanser!  Feels so good, works, all natural.",2
"Last night I applied Dr Jart Cicapair to the terribly itchy insect bites I had on my legs and ankles. I felt some stinging but allowed the cream to dry, then put on compression socks and went to bed. This morning the redness and itching has virtually disappeared! I’m amazed and grateful. I’m ordering another jar, as this stuff works 100% better than the hydrocortisone creams I’d been using. (I should mention that the label on my current jar lists Zinc Oxide as an ingredient. I certainly hope this product has not reinvented itself.) Highly recommended for relief from itching and redness.",2
"I bought this back when Sephora was running the skin care promotion, and love it. I don’t use it on my face (it’s a little too thick for my taste) but it’s been fabulous on my upper arms, where I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin, those little red bumps that look like goosebumps). The Dermadoctor line was a little pricier than I wanted to try, and I thought this would be good as a hand cream if nothing else. It’s just what I needed for my arms - light enough to spread easily but thick enough to stay and do the job. After a week of twice daily use, the difference is dramatic.",2
This is the easiest way to get a flawless glow. Mix 2-4 drops (I am fair) with your moisturizer and done! It is total natural. I just ordered bottle two for the 2022 season.,2
"I got to try this product for free and I’m obsessed. I have very dry skin that gets rough and cracked especially in the winter. This cream works wonders to keep it hydrated each night. You only need a tiny bit and it smells so good. It’s pretty thick, so I wouldn’t wear it during the day, but a fabulous night cream.",2
"I feel like I purchased this cleanser before the explosion of hype online. I felt like it was lightly scented, made my combo skin feel pretty dry. Overall a mediocre experience. The worst part of it though is the pump. It leaked constantly, even when not in use. This is a pretty pricey product to end up pooling on a shelf. I contacted YTTP and they said to remove the pump and put it back in. To be honest, I’d love for them to replace the wasted product caused by faulty packaging just because of the price. Looks like a few other people have had the same issue. I’d skip.",0
I absolutely love this product. I have combo acne prone skin and I a lot of trouble with texture. These make my skin so soft and smooth and leave it looking more radiant and even. The don’t cause any dryness or irritation or make me breakout either. Love what these do for my skin. I highly recommend trying them out for yourself.,2
this is formulated with sodium cocoyl glutamate which is a surfactant (foaming ingredient) derived from coconut oil as the FIRST ingredient. I saw a lot of people mention it left a film on their face or their skin was still oily after washing and I experienced the same. After the 2nd use i saw a medium sized pimple underneath my mouth on left side of my chin. Then the 3rd use of this product I got two more pimples on the right side of my chin. I’m someone who is fairly good with my skin care and don’t experience breakouts due to not having acne-prone or sensitive skin. This was the first product that has broken me out in YEARS. It obviously stems from the surfactant deriving from coconut oil a high comedogenic ingredient. I’m really disappointed because I was really looking forward to enjoying the deluxe size sample I received of this.,0
"Received a small sample from #trywithtopbox. It has a smooth application, feels nice on my skin. I can’t comment on long term use as it was a sample size. Is unscented so that is also nice. #freeproduct",1
"this is sensational! I’ve suffered with dry, patchy lips for my entire adult life. I’m a nervous picker/biter. 3 nights of this and my lips are soft little pillows. Lip stick is finally an option!",2
"After scouring reviews for years lol, I decided to just buy this after trying similar products from other brands that weren’t hydrating enough. What worried me about some reviews is that some people had adverse reactions such as breaking out, itchy skin (a lot of products have done this to me) or a super tacky feeling. As a sensitive skin individual I am so happy to say that none of those things happened to me and I only use clean products so it was a gamble for sure! I like the way it’s dispensed and use a few shakes to cover my face, it leaves me hydrated and supple, similar to an essence. I’m sure if you overdid it on the amount it could feel sticky but I use heavy moisturizers and like to feel like they are working! I’d like to add that I used to have more combination skin in the past, but now I have normal to dry skin, so I’ll even combine this with Tatcha’s dewy skin cream (my go to is Farmacy one but I’m out currently) if that gives you an idea of how I prefer moisture. This product eliminates the need for me to have so many products because I’m a bit too lazy for the 9 step skin routine lol as much as I love the idea. Definitely will repurchase when I’m out ’cause now I’m hooked!",2
"I’m currently expecting my second child and my skin has been going through some crazy things! I have combo/sensitive skin and I started getting these weird discolorations, dry patches and breakouts! I was already using products marketed for sensitive skin - but when I started reading the labels and researching them I realized they were full of chemicals that may be causing a reaction on top of my crazy hormonal skin changes. I was so nervous to try an oil - would it break me out more?! But my skin was so dry and I wanted something natural/organic so I decided to splurge on Josie’s Argan Oil. I could not believe how much better my skin started to look AND feel. It took surviving the winter months for the dry patches to completely go away but I noticed my breakouts cleared up fairly quickly and a nice bonus was some fine lines actually improved! (Didn’t expect that!) I am now using more of her products and I am in LOVE with how well my skin is doing. I strayed from Josie for 2 weeks to try something else - BIG mistake! My skin started breaking out all over again so I learned my lesson! Also the price isn’t bad - some days I’m more generous with the dropper than others and the bottle I purchased has lasted 5 months already so I look at it as $10 a month which is nothing compared to the great results!!!",2
"Love this cleanser, could be a little drying in the winter but great for upstate ny’s humid weather in the summer.",2
I’m always a big fan of Clinique. They’re products always feel good quality on my skin. I loved the texture of this moisturizer gel. Left my skin feeling hydrated and smooth without any greasiness. Would buy again.,2
"Ever since I turned 40 my pores have become noticeably larger than I can ever recall.  After using this product for a week my pores have noticeably shrunk and I don’t feel like I need to cover them up.  I also have very sensitive skin and I was afraid that this product would irritate me but it did not, so that is a huge p lus!  Additionally the produc t makes my skin on my face feel tighter and soft to the touch.",2
"My favorite morning moisturizer! I like using something a little thicker and “goopier” at night (I’m on Farmacy’s All-in-One Repair Salve right now), but this is the PERFECT thing for mornings. It absorbs quickly and tingles just a little, leaving my face fresh and tight, and slightly matte as well!",2
"I use this after moisturizing, it goes on green-ish but turns beige-ish, and makes me use less foundation, which is nice. This product really works on me!",2
"This is a great mask to have on hand for maintenance. It won’t clear up your skin if you’re mid breakout, but it will keep oily skin at bay. Gentle enough not to dry out the skin entirely, although I only need it for my t zone. It’s really smooth, so the removal isn’t as harsh as other masks that add graininess for exfoliation.",1
I had to throw this tin on the ground multiple times to get it to open. Then half of it spilled out. The tinted Vaseline is just better.,0
"I have somewhat sensitive skin, so I was hesitant to try Good Genes but after treading more about the product I decided to give it a go! I use it as a mask treatment 2-3x a week in the morning during my skincare routine and it helps my face look much more lively. I’ve also noticed a major improvement in my skins texture which makes me so happy! I did experience a minor break out when starting it, which I was warned may happen as a purging stage, but it cleared up within a week and my completion has been great since.",2
This is such a good product if you have acne! I had a horrible breakout for a week and had no idea what caused it. So I ordered the 3 pack and used them every other day and it cleared up my skin by the second day! All my acne had gone down to little bumps and by the 5th day it had cleared it up without leaving scars and my skin is glowing. Would buy 30 pack and continuously use it from now on,2
"I have oily/acne prone/sensitive skin, so finding products that work for all three categories can be a challenge. This is one of the only cleansers i’ve found that cleans my skin without over-stripping it, and doesnt leave any residue to clog my pores. I’ve used it for about three months now and its still working great.",2
Great product. Leaves my skin feeling smooth! Putting this on after the Aqua Bomb toner is a must.,2
"It’s def my ride or die! You can’t really tell its function, but it makes ur skin look better and softer.",2
"A great standby that I always come back to. If you love moisturizer like I do (dry skin New Englander), this is a tried and true formula that is thick but not greasy. I think this is in the middle in terms of being light weight vs heavier occlusive. I use this at night because I really like SPF in my moisturizer for daytime (plus sun screen!). It’s AWESOME for reactive skin (soothing and hydrating, I don’t really have sensitive skin just reactive and this is very calming). I tend to use this when for a nighttime routine with a lot of active ingredients since it’s clean and simple, I’ve never had an adverse reaction. I also love YTP adaptogen and Biossance, but this is more bang for your buck in my opinion. CeraVe is great if you’re looking for a lower price alternative.",2
"I got a one packet sample of this. I was so shocked by the two nights of usage that I immediately ordered the large size. I have been to dermatologist after dermatologist, have been on Accutane, have tried proactive, you name it I have tried it. This is the first thing that has made a noticeable difference. I am a teacher and am not dripping in money, but this is worth EVERY PENNY!",2
"This is the second product I have tried from Skinfix, and I love it. Their triple lipid complex must be doing something. It’s hydrating without feeling heavy and uncomfortable. Claiming a skincare product will work for any skin type seems unlikely, but I think this would. The pump on the product is somewhat unique and I think it helps to avoid getting too much out at once, and one pump is enough for a whole face.",2
"I received a sample of this Smart Clinical Repair™ Wrinkle Correcting Serum for free in exchange for my honest review. I used this serum in the day and night after cleansing my skin and applying a toner. I like the feeling of the application of the product as it makes my skin feeling nourished, smoother, and younger-looking. Although I do not have fine lines and wrinkles, my skin does become a bit dry, especially during the cold seasons. This serum is perfect for my dry skin. I did not notice a scent while using the serum, but if there is a scent, it must be very light.",2
"I absolutely love to use this as a first cleanse. It melts down to an oil in your hands and  emulsifies with water added to break down sunscreen and makeup. It really helps me gently wash away my mascara and eyeliner! I will definitely purchase again. My only gripe is that it does separate in the tube a bit and sometimes pours out oil and then the cleanser comes out. It all breaks down into an oil in your hands anyway, but it’s a bit more messy when it separates, which is why I gave it 4 stars.",1
I received Skinlongevity as a free sample from PINCHme. I was super impressed with this product. I felt like my skin looked smoother and brighter. I definitely plan to purchase this product,2
I was expecting more from this considering all the hype around it. It’s a perfectly fine heavy moisturizer. It wears a little bit like the Embryolisse Lait‑Creme except it’s a little bit thicker consistency and doesn’t leave the skin feeling quite as smooth. It didn’t pill or leave my face feeling overly greasy. Overall it’s nice and does its job so to speak but I don’t think it’s a game changer or really worth the price.,1
Great product! Wish it was a bit more moisturizing. I can only put a small quantity or it makes my skin feel very dry afterwards.,1
"i really like it , it does brighten and give you a glow but i do have to take off a star because if you use it everyday it literally runs out in a month, maybe 2 if you’re lucky. it’s a nice product if you want to splurge but there’s plenty of other products that do the same that won’t cost you an arm and leg every other month",1
"It is a multi-purpose cream, moisturizing and light, I like to use it on the face, hands and when the sun hits my skin.",2
"This face oil is very moisturizing. I use a few drops with another moisturizer in the morning. At night, I just use it by itself. Very little goes a long way! I love the ingredients and the fact that most of them are from organic farming! Rose hip oil is the first ingredient.  I have definitely noticed a glow!",2
"This moisturizer is probably the best product I’ve taken a gamble at trying without looking much into it first. I fell in love with the smell and cute packaging and after eyeing it for a while I caved in and bought it as a self birthday gift. It’s perfect for my oily skin because it doesn’t feel greasy at all or sticky, it actually melts into my skin and does a nice job at keeping me hydrated without that heavy lotion feel. My skin has definitely been more clear and soft after I started using this which is a huge plus! Even though it’s a little pricey I’d honestly say it’s worth it, if the amount you get for the price worries you a little goes a very long way.",2
This product has SIGNIFICANTLY reduced my acne scars within the first week of use. Cannot recommend this enough!!!,2
I got this as a sample and as soon as I used it I went online and ordered the full size. I’ve been using it for about 4 months now and It’s a dream for my sensitive combination skin. It absorbs perfectly and never feels oily or heavy but my skin still feels very moisturized even in the winter (which is really dry where I live) Pro tip: this one comes in the “Exfoliate + Deeply Hydrate Kit” and it’s the same size (2oz) but you also get 2 other mini products and it’s only an extra $5!,2
"I had my eye on this face mask for about three months, and yesterday I caved. I immediately came home and used it. OMG. Love!!!! I have oily skin, so I thought it might be too hydrating, but it is perfect. I used it again this morning, and I am still in love.",2
I have been using this facial soap for many years now and its my absolute my favroite . i have combination skin it cleanses without drying or hurting. worth the $$,2
"For far, this is the best cleanser. My skin is oily but dehydrated. I need to wash my face twice a day, but after that it is always dry, very dry... BUT this cleanser is a good one, good brand, cleans well (and smell like cucumber, so fresh!) and after washing my face, doesnt feel dry. So i totally reccomend it for skins like mine.",2
I find this to be gently yet highly effective at removing waterproof mascara.  This is my 3rd purchase.,1
"I received these products for free from Influenster and Tatcha in exchange for my honest review. Super excited for this, it’s the most amazing packaging and I can’t wait to try this and see how my skin feels and does! It’s light weight, and absorbs in the skin, feels wonderful and hydrating! To be continued…#myessence #complimentary @Influenster @tatcha",2
I received this with my last order which was great because I really like these new oil based cleansers. The small trial size was actually quite generous and has allowed me to really test out the product. I found that I really don’t need to use a lot so this small size will last a while. I love the way this applies and I find it to be really silky on my skin. It removes dirt and makeup well and comes off easily with a warm wash cloth. I’m not 100% sure if I would purchase but I’m enjoying the trial size.,2
"My skin background is ultra sensitive and combination - dry patches and oily areas that all break out. I’ve used body shops vitamin e line for a while but even the night cream and serums weren’t thick enough, my skin dried out almost instantly. I resorted to coconut oil for moisture and Vaseline to attempt to seal it in, nothing was working. A very helpful ruby rose doppelgänger at Sephora recommended this line; what an amazing cream. I got the small tube to test and I will be getting the biggest one next time! My skin was moisturizer all night. I usually wake up with really oily skin (from not getting enough moisture) but I didn’t even need to wash my face. It was instantly soothing upon application (the oatmeal) and it felt like it sunk down deep enough. . My dry patches aren’t red anymore and didn’t sting when applying! Amazing amazing stuff, I’ve already recommended it. Note, each person is different and it takes a while to find out what works for your individual self, so if something doesn’t work, that’s why Sephora has a great return policy people!",2
"Great moisturizer! a little goes a long way, super thick but doesnt feel thick and heavy on the skin! if you have oily skin and sensitive skin this is great for you!",1
"I have been using this for a couple of months now and I have not seen any difference in my Oiliness or breakouts. Throughout the day, I unfortunately become more oily especially on my forehead and chin after cleansing with this product and using my other prescribed acne medications. Once I don’t use the cleanser I dont wake up with an oily residue nor does my face become oily. I am just going to switch back to using REN Cleansing gel. Although, I must say after the shower and then doing my routine it does make my face feel somewhat cleansed when used.",1
"This mask is everything. I literally look forward to using it and that’s a big change for me. I love that you can wear it to bed and don’t have to wash it off. Game changer. I wear it alone and workout, under my makeup, and to bed. Like I said, it’s everything. I’ll be stocking up for sure!",2
this has completely changed my skin. i started using this a year ago. my skin used to always have lots of tiny bumps and i couldn’t get rid of them. my skin texture has improved drastically and my skin tone is much more even,2
"Between the harsh winter and being on Accutane, my lips are taking a beating. I’ve been going through lip balm like crazy since my lips are so cracked and bleeding. A coworker (who’s also on Accutane) told me about this and that it helped immediately. I gave it a try and within a day my lips started feeling better! It absorbs really well into your lips so you’re not left with a thick layer like some lip balms can leave. It smells amazing too. Will definitely be repurchasing!",2
Love this mask. Religious lip balm wearer but this mask makes such a huge difference. I don’t know if I can ever be without it!,2
"I would prefer to rate this as 3.5 but I am unable to. The price point is truly not bad at all because most facial mask are 55 bucks on up. The packaging is clear which isn’t the best for keeping the good ingredients optimum but this isn’t uncommon in most cosmetics products. The ingredients in the mask is clean so that’s a bonus. This mask reminds me a lot of the clinique overnight moisture surg mask. The texture is whipped and creamy so it does sink into my skin pretty quickly. For some reason I am turned off by the smell. It smells like beer to me. I do experience a slightly tingling effect but it literally only last for 15 to 30 seconds. Overall, I have to say this mask does not work well for me overnight.  I never notice a difference when I am using it overnight.  It’s like, I wake up and it feel like I haven’t put anything on my face (by the way this with a complete facial regime). As strange as this may sound, I experience the most benefits when I keep this mask on for about 10 to 20 mins and then rinse it off. When I do that, my skin feels smooth and hydrated.  I don’t notice much of brightening effect. I mainly use it for hydration.  Overall I probably will not repurchase willingly because I rather explore other mask. The only other overnight mask I have tried was PTR cucumber & rose mask and clinique overnight mask. I have never really noticed a huge difference when using any of these overnight mask. Overall this is a decent mask. I Can’t say there’s better overnight mask out there because I personally haven’t tried many. I just know the mask by fresh (necter vitamin c, Sugar scrub polish and the black tea instant perfection) all have did my skin justice.",1
So far this seems to be a good SPF. It has not left a white cast and it wore well under makeup. The only concern I have is that it seem to pill on my hand which was strange. I noticed the white cast there and it accentuated dryness on my hand. Very strange. I’ll keep monitoring to see how it does in my skin.,1
"I LOVE Rosebud Salve...I tried to live without it the last few months and just could not find anything to compare to it’s awesomeness. The smell is yummy and slightly floral, the texture is silky and smooth on the lips without being greasy or sticky. It is the ultimate lip balm. I have also used it on occasion to soothe a dry patch or blemish when moisturizer was not available. I give only this warning....DO NOT order this product during the heat of summer or leave it in your car in the sun. It will melt! BUT, as long as you keep it indoors it will last forever! Love it...and boys seem to like it to because its colorless, it doesn’t leave any kiss marks.",2
Need very little & puffiness definitely decreases!,1
Gifted by fresh- extremely hydrating and smells amazing. Having champed lips in the summer is the worst and this has been my go-to! It even adds a very subtle lip color which I absolutely love! I would 100% recommend,2
I wrote a detailed review on my blog! https://themostbeautifulmakeupispassion.wordpress.com/2016/01/03/battle-of-the-brands-josie-maran-100-pure-argan-oil-vs-physicians-formula-argan-wear-ultra-nourishing-argan-oil/,1
This wonderful gel moisturizer gifted is very hydrating and moisturizing while still being in the form of a light gel. It does leave my skin bright and glowing as well as very hydrated and plump. I also really like the refillable pod which creates less trash. Another great product from glow recipe!,2
"I received this Daily Microfoliant complimentary from Dermalogica in exchange for my honest review. This is a very useful exfoliator, and makes my skin feel so clean after using it! It is a gentle exfoliator too so I love that I can use this every day on my skin with no worries! My skin definitely looks a bit brighter after using this exfoliator regularly!",2
I was steptical of this product because there was so much hype about it - and the hefty price tag. This transformed my skin in less than a week. I had very deep set acne scarring and it has reduced by 1/2. IN LESS than a week!! I will never stop using this product. Every day I use it my skin has gotten better. Just make sure to use an spf!!,2
I had really dry and cracked lips for what felt like months and it was so frustrating and painful to deal with. I tried using my Smith’s rosebud salve and it just wasn’t doing it for me. My friend recommended this product to me a few days before an event and after using it I have never been happier to start wearing lipsticks again. This mask completely transformed them! I use it every night now.,2
I am so glad that i was given this opportunity to try this samples gifted by Dermologica sampIing campaign. used this for seven days and i am loving the results. I am definitely going to buy full size . These has made my skin look smooth and soft.,2
I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes. This product does everything it claims!! One pump easily covers the entire face. It smells amazing. I wake up every morning with my skin smooth and refreshed! It has a very slight tingly feeling that lets you know the acids are going to work! It did not dry out or irritate my skin. Highly recommend!!,2
I have been using this product for several months. Switched from Purity Made Simple. I use that in the shower in the morning. This product gets all my mascara off with very little effort...no raccoon eyes which I had with Purity.. My makeup come right off and my face feels amazing when I’m done!! So soft. I follow with Clinique Clarifying Lotion. Cotton ball is always clean. My only complaint would be the ring of make-up left in the sink but it does just rinse away. Next time I’m getting the big bottle!,2
"Before this I really wanted to wear foundation but no matter how I apply it I feel like I’m doing it wrong, but this Dr Jart  just makes a really great difference and I like it a lot better than the foundations I’ve tried. It’s very lightweight and it has sunscreen!",2
"This is so far the best toner I’ve used, on my fourth bottle now. I have oily skin but my forehead can be both dehydrated and oily at the same time (weird...) especially in winter. This toner is super hydrating and it feels so light-weight. For some other toners which advertise for their deep hydration, they can be sticky and I hate that feeling. This one is just different. Moreover, I STOPPED GROWING ACNE!! That is just miracle. I’m a skincare fanatic and I purchase different products every time when I shop in Sephora. This is the only toner which I am 100% sure that it helped my acne situation a lot.Although the scent is not pleasant at all... but the result definitely worth the 2-second suffering when you are applying it lmao.",2
"I love love love this!. I wish however that sephora would sell the travel size not sure why they stopped and only offer it in gift sets as the tacha website sells the travel size. But anyway I love this enzyme powder, it’s gentle that I can use it more then once a week and I have bought this over and over and over again. This is my first time buying the full size as I use to get the travel size on its own or in a gift set. I little go a long way and the travel size amount actually lasts me a long time. With this product I notice that it helps my skin in my t-zone and the area right under my bottom lips to feel smooth. I stopped using this because Sephora wasn’t telling the travel size version anyone and bought something else which did nothing for my skin. Now I finally bought the full size and happy to be using this product again.",2
"Prior to this review, I haven’t been one to write reviews. This product is so AMAZING it deserves the unconventional response. As a woman drippin in melanin this product works. No white cast, no greasy feeling, and all the protection I need. Ok Supergoop! take my money!",2
"I initially got this mask as a sample, and went back to buy the full product the next week. This is a great mask to help even and tighten your skin, and has helped with my acne a lot as well. I consider this to be more of a light weight mask since it does not leave the skin very dry and I use it 2-3 times a week. It has an interesting texture - more of a gel than a traditional facemask.",2
Super smooth! Smells delicious. I love it!! I wear it every day before make up or to work out and it is perfect,2
I absolutely love this product! My skin gets so dry in winter but this products helps so much in keeping it moistured and is the perfect base to start my makeup! I’m so obsessed. It gives me the smoothest finish and look. This was gifted,2
"I like that it doesn’t break out my skin & isn’t too greasy, but it pills sooo bad when I use it after my serums and moisturizer. I’d only recommend this product if it’s the only thing you put on your face.",1
"I received The Essence complimentary from Influenster. I can’t belive I haven’t used an essence in my skin care routine before! Ever since I tried it it’s a must! It makes my skin feel very hydrated, absorbs into the skin really fast and definitely makes my skin very soft! I would definitely buy another bottle when I finish this one! Totally recommend!",2
I use this both as a sleeping mask and during the day. I originally received a sample and was comparing it to a sample of Illi mask. The Laneige mask moisturized my lips and saw improvement vs Illi no difference after multiple uses. Love to try gummy bear and other flavors.,2
This is an awesome product. It can be used on your hair and/or skin and leaves it soft and supple...not greasy. It’s a definite must buy and I’d reccommend it for combination skin types as well as dry.,2
"I really enjoyed the feel and non greasiness, smoothness & how it made my face & neck look & feel.  It is truly a wonderful and fabulous product!",1
I think the consistency is quite nice and thick. Did not experience any bumps or breakouts but unfortunately I have to quit this item because of the ingredients. PEG and EDTA etc. If this had better ingredients it would be my holy grail item.,0
"I usually use Korres Pomegranate Moisturizer during the summer, but I thought that I would try this moisturizer because it was less expensive. After 2.5 weeks I just had to return it because I had tons of pimples under my skin and the worst that I’ve had in the last year was a stress zit! I couldn’t believe it! Maybe it’s the unnatural ingredients in this moisturizer, but it caused me to breakout for the first time in years. I would definitely not recommend this moisturizer to anyone unless they want to get zits.",0
"As someone that’s tried at home ‘peels’ before I must admit this is the best I’ve tried, especially because of the price. My 45 year old skin is clear, soft and glowing. This absolutely gets rid of pesky texture and for me, reduces the appearance of pores. I’m able to use it 3-4 times a week with minimal tingle. If your face is wet or freshly washed and not completely dry it will tingle more.  Seriously a must try, especially if you’ve thought about purchasing something much more expensive. You won’t be disappointed!",2
"I wanted to love this mask so much because it looked so good. I put this mask on just like it told me to and as soon as it was sitting on my face for 2 minutes it started to tingle and burn my skin. It isn’t hydrating at all, it feels like it has peppermint or something in it. It made my skin very red and irritated! Do not use if you have sensitive skin.",0
"So far, I’ve been loving it. I’ve used it a couple of times, and neither time did I have sensitivity issues. I have used DE babyfacial in the past, but I’m in quarantine away from my usual products and couldn’t justify spending the money when I have a full bottle at home! This has worked well for me, plus the blood-like appearance is pretty metal.",2
It doesn’t foam up a whole lot I think it turns into a more milky consistency but it removes my makeup really nice and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. I have combination skin and I feel like this would be a pretty good cleanser for most of not all skin types.,2
WOW is all I can say about this cleanser! I don’t wear makeup so it really does the job to really wash away the dirt and grime at the end of the day. My face feels so clean once I finish washing and doesn’t feel dry. Would recommend to everyone!,2
"So far, I’ve been using a trial size and I am absolutely in love! I have dry to very dry skin so I’ve been on a hunt for a good cleansing product that will take off my makeup without leaving my skin looking like a dried prune.I’ve been using a Clarin’s cleaning FOAM, so I was really excited to try this cleansing oil. It is quite different from other non cleansing foams that I’ve tried because it lathers a bit which is what I like. It’s also great because it does not feel oily or leave a greasy residue on my skin. I also love eating kale so the smells is quite refreshing and doesn’t smell artificial or too fragranced.I am definitely going to purchase the full size!!!",2
I really wanted to like this cleanser. It smells great and my face felt mositurized after use but the consistency of the oil was much to thick for me. It felt like i was rubbing paste over my face. It didnt help with removing my eye makeup either. I always have to use another cleanser for my face to feel clean afterwards. Will be looking for another cleansing oil.,0
"I decided to give this a go based on the fact that it contains a form of Vitamin C called Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate (THD) that is much more stable than L-Ascorbic Acid.  It has a scent - I like it, it smells like orange juice.  I do think the serum is way too thick, though.  And the bottle is deceptively small",1
"I received this as a complimentary from Shiseido and I LOVE it so far!!!!! My skin is on the oily side and this is VERY moisturizing, but I feel my eyes need more moisturize than the rest of my face.",2
"This cream is heavenly! I love It cosmetics products and their skincare never disappoints! This cream is the perfect everyday moisturizer for anti aging benefits and  provides so much moisture to your skin. It’s a thick cream and when I apply it to my skin it immediately calms down my redness and seals all my skincare products into my skin. I use it everyday, morning and night and it is perfect for any skin type including sensitive skin. It’s a must have staple!",2
"I love cleansers that you rub on dry skin. For some reason they seem to work better. This one leaves my skin clean with no filmy/greasy after feel. I gave it 4 out of 5 though because it never quite gets all my eye makeup off--and I don’t wear that much! So if you don’t mind using a separate eye makeup remover, I’d definitely recommend this product.",1
"This product smells very good and I love the feeling of it as it goes on to my skin. As far as keeping my skin matte, I don’t feel like it keeps it matte completely I still have oil come through within a few hours. I do feel like it works well with my skin though. I am going to keep trying it out and see if I notice a difference",1
I love the Josie Maran Moroccan Argan Oil and thought this would be a nice addition but it seems to separate in the tube so I get the oil before the cream.,0
"it’s ok. It did leave my face dry and refreshed, but that’s pretty all it did for me. It didn’t reduce or prevent acne from growing, nor did it do anything to my blackheads; however, it is easy to apply and rinse off while not having any weird or unbearable scent.",1
"Honest god sent. I have always had acne prone skin since I was 13 years old and it’s taken a lot of experimenting to find the right product to do a good job of cleansing my skin and getting rid of my acne scars and acne, white heads, all that fun stuff. This is by far the one I could recommend to anyone, it’s gentle on the skin, it helped me with my acne scarring, and I had a couple large scars on my chin for years but after using this product for a month it has helped amazingly. I slowly start to see the results and my skin looks hydrated, feels clean, and for the price point I am in love with this product. I will not be using any other cleanser but this one as it has helped me quite a lot.",2
I have both this one and the mint one and I like both of them. They are really shiny and not sticky.,2
This product is such a life changer! My lips were always SO chapped no matter the product I used. My lips remain hydrated the entire day!!! plus you don’t have to use a lot to see results. Love this!,2
Absolutely love this! Buy buy buy! I have cystic hormonal acne the most sensitive skin ever...and this keeps it under control. I use it in my morning and nighttime skincare routine and it has definitely helped to keep my acne under control and even improve scarring and discolouration. It can be a bit drying if overused - so just make sure that you moisturize after use. Buy this.,2
WORKS!!! Used points to get deluxe sample of this. Applied morning and night for three days- my under eyes are truly brighter. I was low key hoping it wouldn’t work so I wouldn’t be tempted to buy the full size! If the price turns you off get a sample or a set with a mini and use consistently for a couple days. I now use caffeine de-puffing eye cream in the morning and this at night to maintain my lightened under eyes. Too soon to talk about wrinkle reduction but 5 starts for brightened under eyes and that alone makes me SO happy.,2
"This is the first serum I’ve ever purchased. One bottle lasted me about two full months using two pumps day and night. I definitely felt like I had smoother skin soon after using it. Although the pore reduction was not super noticeable, and it didn’t really have any effect on my acne, I am overall satisfied with product in smoothing my skin.",1
"Perfectly hydrating night mask. I have super dry skin and this is just magical, my skin feels moisturized, hydrated and super soft.",2
Wonderful for fine lines and dark circles. I’ve been issuing this for several months and can tell the difference in fine lines. The lightweight cream has a luxurious moisturizing property.,2
"I have very dry skin, even in the summer. I am not prone to breakouts, except around my chin and mouth area - I was never able to put any kind of moisturizer in this area because it would lead to instant breakouts.I have tried everything from the drug store to very high end moisturizers, and nothing has ever really made my skin feel hydrated, and everything always made my chin/mouth area breakout, even if it was for sensitive skin. Once I started using this product, my skin never feels dry, it soaks right in and does not leave a greasy residue, and I can put it on my chin and around my mouth without breaking out. I use this product before I go to bed, and I use the Light version in the morning before I put on my makeup.This is a great product for very dry skin and I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from flakiness or dryness, including in sensitive areas on the face. My husband also has very dry skin and he started using it too, and he loves it. This is definitely my holy grail moisturizer.",2
"If I put this on at any point in my beauty routine, it leaves my face sticky - even if it is the only thing I’ve put on.  I didn’t want to waste my money by tossing it, though, so I’ve been using the “7 skin method“ by taking this with me to the bath and putting it on my face 7 (okay, maybe more like 4 or 5) times over the course of my relaxing bath..  It is hydrating and seems to soften my skin after it’s been rinsed off after all that.  Just a suggestion for those who bought it and don’t like it, but I wouldn’t recommend it or buy it again.",1
"Amazing moisturizer, one of the best for my skin.,the brand itself is great, but it’s the first time I tried the rose moisturizer, and felt in love with it. Great, so easy to apply, great packaging to last a lot. I’m very satisfied with its quality.",2
"This is honestly the only makeup removed wipes I have found that don’t irritate my skin. I love these and I highly recommend. I have also tried the rose ones, they are also nice but these ones are my favorite.",2
"For my nighttime skincare routine, I use the double cleanse method when washing my face. I use this first to remove my makeup and follow up with a gel cleanser. Its effective at removing my makeup and I love the buttery smooth texture gliding on my skin; feels luxurious.I prefer it to the Farmacy Green Clean Cleansing Balm.",2
"Gifted by Fresh in exchange for a review. Love the subtle color it has, it’s sheer but you can build it up. The formula is very nice, it’s hydrating and makes my lips softer. I always have one of these in my purse.",2
"I received this as a sample and I love it! You barley need any to exfoliate the whole face. It felt amazing as I was using it. I don’t think I’ll be purchasing it though since the price is outragous. Maybe the .5 oz... but other than that, if I had the money for it, I would so purchase this in the large size!",1
"Product is light feeling on the skin. It has become a great part of my routine. Since I’m closer to 40, I’ve noticed more fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. The results from this have already been noticeable and I’ve been trying it for a week.",2
Love how smooth and moisturizing this product is. The citrusy scent threw me a little but overall I think it’s a great base.,1
"I really like this product! It dries relatively quick so you aren’t left waiting forever. It isn’t TOO messy ( it is black, so be prepared) and is easy to rinse off. You can actually FEEL it working which is incredible.",1
"I wanted to love this but this balm is moreso a light and weak gloss. I expected more for a $17 tube. It does smell like pear, is clear,  and provides slight glossiness that is a tad sticky. Overall, would not purchase again because you have to keep reapplying for hydration and gloss. Not good for dryness. On a different note, I did love the sleeping mask and found it extremely hydrating.",0
Wow just love the way this multi tasks from a sleep mask to a lip balm I recently learned it has 4 berries in it that’s what gives the red hue but love the way my lips feel in the morning it’s crazy but I like this better then some of my more expensive lip treatments my lips are fuller!,2
THIS IS SO WORTH IT!!! YOU CAN SEE YOUR DEAD SKIN FALLING OFF IN JUST A FEW SECONDS!!!,2
"Got sample and didn’t notice anything good or bad, but after a week I got a rather larger zit. I can count on one hand how many breakouts I’ve had in 5 years. That was the clincher and in the trash it went. I don’t understand the reviews on this.",0
"I saw JStar and Tati talk about this stuff on YouTube and I was sooo skeptical about it because I have oily, oily, oily skin. I’m sooooo acne prone too and I’m in my mid twenties. You guys. I love this stuff. A tiny bit goes a long way and it feels so calming and nourishing on my face. I didn’t think I’d like it but after my cleansing regimen, I love this under makeup. My foundation glides so nicely over this. I’m not sure I’m going to love this in the Summer as much but we’ll see.",2
"This stuff is amazing! It feels so nice on my skin and makes it feel soft, supple, and moisturized. I use it daily and am loving it so much!!! It also has a nice clean smell that isn’t overpowering, which i also love because I’m not a fan of products with too much fragrance.",2
Love how it keeps my lips hydrated all day! It’s perfect for cold windy weather. Can be used day and night.,2
"I have very dry skin and it just drank this up!! I absolutely love how my skin has been looking after only a few days of use. It’s evened out my skin tone, my pores are less noticeable, and I really love how cooling it is and the watermelon scent is so pleasant!It’s easy to disperse into my hands and it feels so good when I apply it. It’s an amazing toner that I feel like I can’t live without!",2
"I received the cleansing balm in a Clinique kit recently.  I like that it’s non-scented so when I remove liquid lipstick there’s no fragrance taste leftover on my lips.  It works pretty good.  I have used it just as a regular cleanser and also to remove a full face of makeup: primer, foundation, eyeliner/shadow, setting spray etc.  I have a different cleansing balm I like better because it seems to remove liquid lip and eye makeup better (and it’s cheaper).  The Clinique balm took a few tries with the liquid lip and didn’t fully melt away the eye makeup.  Maybe I needed to use more.  As I’ve gotten older the area around my eyes are sensitive to makeup wipes and removers (especially milk products) so I like that this cleansing balm didn’t irritate my eyes upon application.  And my skin did feel soft and clean afterwards.",1
I do like this toner. Sometimes it feels harsh but I say I use this every other day and it definitely gets what my cleanser misses.,1
"I absolutely loveee this product! It is honestly the best for oily skin and maybe even for all skin types, it leaves the skin glowing and hydrated and definitely noticed a difference in my skin when I started using this!",2
Can’t get enough of this stuff! Really nice lip balm with the classic scent we all love. I have two of them because I don’t ever want to be without one,2
Amazing! This oil cleanser really broke down my make up and sunscreen and left my skin feeling soft and clean. Perfect for pre-cleansing before another cleanser .,2
"ok, i’m always skeptical about most skin products and I’ve used a lot of high end brands. I got this in a 500 pt reward gift and I have to say, it is really amazing, gentle AND effective! I even used it on my elbows and it made a difference. This will be my next purchase at Sephora for sure!! thank you ptr for a great product!!!",2
"Made me break out and overly dried my skin, I don’t recommend!",0
The ultra facial cream is my favorite kiehls product that i keep coming back to again and again. Its thick but not too heavy and perfect for the winter and summer alike. I continue to repurchase season after season.,2
I loved this facial mask since I’ve been looking for a high end mask that helps with hyperpigmentation and doesn’t dry me out. I’ve only been using it for a weeks but see an improvement on the look and feel of my skin. I would recommend that you have an already established skin care routine before using this.,1
I absolutely adore this product ! Its super hydrating and helped my dry skin!,2
"LOVE these cotton squares. I can remove all my makeup using one square ( and I do wear a full face of makeup). One side to do my eyes and flip it over and do my face. They are more expensive initialy but when I figured out how many cotton rounds I was using a day ( 4) versus one of these, this is hands down a better deal and it feels so soft!",2
It feels great! So light and airy yet moisturizing. It doesn’t weigh my eyes down or make my face feel tired. It actually lifts it up. I really enjoy this product.,2
I began using this as a sample and am totally hooked. The oil is not oily for my normal to dry skin and my skin texture and clarity is much healthier. I have never used a product where I can confidently say it was doing something better for my skin but here i totally can.,2
"I love this stuff on my elbows, hands, and when my face was getting some dry patches I used it. Not greasy at all. Great product! Worth a $12 tube because a little goes a long way.",2
I AM READY TO SEE IF DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA  EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEEL WOULD GIVE MY AGING SKIN A OVER ALL THAT WOULD YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN AGING AND FINE LINES AROUND MY EYES AND MOUTH PLUS OVER ALL FRESH NEW SKIN SO ON DAY ONE I APPLY MY EXFOLIATE AND SMOOTH ON YOUR DRY SKIN YOU USE IT TILL PAD DRY AFTER MY TWO MINUTE WAIT I APPLY ANTI-AGING NEUTRALIZER WHICH I REPEATED THESE STEPS FOR THREE DAYS AND I NOTICED ON DAY ONE TREATMENT MY SKIN WAS BRINGING UP A NEW SKIN WITH A SMOOTH SOFT FEELING ON DAY TWO I NOTICED THAT MY DARKER SKIN TONE WAS LIGHTING UP ON DAY THREE I HAVE NOW SOFT SKIN LIGHTER TONE AND MY FINE LINES WHERE LESS NOTICEABLY I REALLY FEEL IF I CONTINUE USING DR DENNIS GROSS ALPHA BETA EXTRA STRENGTH DAILY PEELI WILL BE LOOKING A YEAR YOUNGER OR TWO WHICH MAKES YOUR WHOLE ATTITUDE FEEL SO GOOD ABOUT YOUR SELF SO DO NOT TAKE MY WORD I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU GO OUT AND GET YOUR SELF THIS PRODUCT AND YOU WILL BE SURPRISED WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE HEAD TURNING TO GET A SECOND LOOK AT YOU !,2
"A great everyday sunscreen! Light, absorbs well, and layers under make up really nicely.",2
"I received this product free from influenster for my honest opinion. I used this for about two weeks I use it every other 3 days because I don’t want to damage my skin and dry it out. I use it during the morning and with the amazing orange scent, it totally wakes me up and gets me started! Since I don’t use it every day, it doesn’t dries out my skin completely instead it is hydrating and takes away a lot of my dead skin cells. I will definitely continue this as part of my morning routine",1
I received this in my trendmood volume 7 box and it is fantastic! Makes my skin feel super hydrated and good. Love it!,1
"Didn’t work for me... not nearly moisturizing enough, my face felt dry just an hour after applying a pretty thick layer. Didn’t see any pore improvement either.",0
I love Hyaluronic Acid. This serum is so sold for the skin to retain the skin’s moisture. I really noticed that my skin looks and feels more hydrated. Some of my dry patches have vanished. I can I say I will keep using this serum in my skincare routine. I love how everything from this brand is very affordable.,2
"I LOVE THIS CREAM! I have absolutely horrible eczema on my lower legs that have left with me dry itchy patches. They often itch so badly that I have scratched so hard and drawn blood. Anyway, my legs looked like a battlefield before this amazing tub of cream came along. I went from being ashamed of my legs to wearing shorts in 10 days. It hydrates like no other and I swear it has cleared up my eczema better than the expensive prescription steroid creams I was using. Buy it!! You will never try anything else.",2
"This is it. Everything I have ever looked for in a cleanser. I have tried RIDICULOUS amounts of other products on my quest to find something that works for my highly reactive, dry, blemish prone skin... This is the best because it cleanses incredibly well, removes all makeup, even eye makeup, and it doesn’t dry out or irritate at all! I follow up with the ultimate repair face lotion and my skin has never looked or felt this good!!",2
"I have acne prone skin and very oily too, so I have tried many products to try to improve the look of my face. And this is the best product I’ve ever used!  I use it once a day before bed and twice a week I mix Framboos with some Lala Retro. In a few days my blackheads are gone, the texture is great, my skin is softer and smoother, I also noticed some dark sposts lightening, my pores are more tight too. I’m in love with this product, it’s a holly grail!It is a powerful serum but does not irritate the skin like others I have tested.  Every night I am grateful to have tested this product, my skin is radiant like baby skin.",2
"Super fun product to use!  Pour the powder in your hand and add just a touch of water to make a paste. You can feel the micro-exfoliators as you scrub and it smells a bit like oatmeal, which is nice. It didn’t over exfoliate and it made my skin feel freshened and smooth.",1
Feels like air on my skin. Not sticky or slimy. It visibly reduced pores and fine lines in less than 5 minutes. High quality product!,2
"Amazing , smell nice very fast absorbing",2
As soon as you apply this into the skin you can see it plumping the skin. I Have been using this for over 2 months and I am seeing better results in my skin. Its pricey but well worth the money!,2
"Another hit from Fresh! Sometimes the scents can be too much for me but the scent did not irritate me at all, I love the ingredients of this new serum, specifically the niacinamide. My pores are not super visible but I feel like this serum refines the look of the pores on my cheeks. It gives me a glow and leaves me looking refreshed.",2
"I first tried this as part of the Skin Wonderland kit that was released this year and wow, it did not disappoint. I have sensitive eyes that typically react to makeup wipes and I’ve been shelling out big bucks for other cleansing oils that weren’t doing the best job. This product is unreal, it smells amazing, doesn’t irritate my eyes whatsoever and cuts through eyeliner, lash glue, heavy foundation etc with no problem. This has earned a lifetime spot in my skincare routine!",2
"LOVE this mask! I’ve had it for about a month now and it’s perfect for my skin type- sensitive, combo, acne. I leave it on over night and wake up with plumped and glowing skin! I plan on using it under makeup as a primer soon, too :) I also love the brand itself and their self-care Sunday tips on instagram each week. Can’t wait to see what else this Summer Fridays comes out with!",2
"it does the job and does it well!  It is thick, but soaks in quickly and is how it is so effective.",2
"I was skeptical of the rave reviews, but have to agree that this is a great product. I find it a little heavy to wear under foundation, but it works well as a quick weekend foundation substitute. It really does cover redness, although I found I still had to use a little concealer on a couple spots/broken capillaries.",1
"This cleanser is literally the best! I have tried several and this by far exceeds them all. Its non-drying, gentle and leaves my face nice and clean. It can also be used around the eye area with no irritation. One of my ffavorite attributes is the gentle foam it creates. I will always use this cleanser!",2
"After using this product my face felt great and the product wasn’t sticky like other serums! Love it!Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good C serum. The smell is light, and didn’t cause any breakouts or blemishes.",2
I thought I would I would love it but it was so thick. I followed the direction of splash and then put the balm on. Double cleansed and used a toner afterward. I still was able to pick up some traces of makeup. I’ll stick to my Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm.,0
"my first time using and purchasing a toner! I’ve heard so much great things about this toner so I had to give it a try and it did not disappoint! it’s not only a pretty looking bottle, it also work it’s magic..",2
"I love all natural beauty care and I love this serum! Its pricey but I feel it enhances the radiance of my skin and effectively fades my dark sun and acne spots, evening my complexion. Its pricey but worth it. I’m putting 4 bottles in my budget for 2013..I tend to be a little heavy-handed with my beauty care products but I feel confident that I can make one bottle last for 3 months.",2
"I like this moisturizer a lot! I received it for free for testing purpose and I’m so happy I did. I think it smells nice, it reminds me of a creamsicle. Also I think it makes my skin nice and soft. It has not cause me to breakout and it adds a nice glow to my skin. Also the packaging is nice and straight forward. My only con to the product is it doesn’t have spf in it, which is important. But then again since it doesn’t have spf in it I can use the moisturizer for night and day!",1
"This product is legit, but not miraculous. I have a lot of acne, everywhere. It didn’t not do that much for my face acne, but it didn’t worsen it, it did diminish the amount of breakout I get when I’m on my period but did not reduce them by more than 40%. But for my back acne and chest acne, it did help quite a bit, they don’t get big zits anymore, just bumps and redness.Though, for a lower prices there are similar products you can get at the drugstore.This product is very refreshing and removes a lot of oil from my face, but it leaves my skin sticky and with a weird shine/glow in weird points of my face.In conclusion, it’s a decent product, but not a holy grail. Personally, it didn’t break me out, but did not solve my acne problem, so I will not be repurchasing.",1
Great product! Will definitely be buying this again.,2
"This product has seriously saved me. I have extremely dry skin, especially on my lips, and normally I suffer through the cold weather with dry, cracked, bleeding lips because nothing is strong enough. This somehow repairs everything overnight and I wake up with with the softest lips in the world. I find it works best when I apply a thick layer, which I assume was the mistake some of the negative reviewers made; if you apply this like a lip balm it is not going to give you the same results.",2
Instantly does the job . Incredible for no makeup makeup days or when you want to wear a bb cream . Perfect product for photo shoots . Easy application and Seamless blend,2
"This feels luxurious, lasts a long time, and dissolves waterproof mascara easily. I haven’t had breakouts, or any skin or eye sensitivity with it.",2
"Cannot stress this enough, AMAZING! I use this product 1-2 times a week at night and I wake up with a glow that resembles a day in the sun. I only use about 2-3 drops and mix it with a pea sized amount of moisturizer. Side note: do not forget to wash your hands off after or you’ll stain them!!",2
"I’ve been using this serum for about two weeks. I haven’t noticed any drastic changes yet, but it does go on smoothly and soaks into the skin well. There is virtually no scent and doesn’t irritate my skin.",1
"This is super moisturizing and lasts all day. Other products have left my face feeling tacky but this one is smooth, absorbs right into the skin and lasts all day. I have a combination skin type, it doesn’t make my face feel oily at all.",2
"if someone were to blind fold me and ask me how much I think this product was truly worth.. not seeing the brand or the packaging and having no idea where it came from, this is literally no different than the moisturizer I use and buy for 12$ spend your money elsewhere this is not worth almost 200$",0
Creamy and refreshing. I received this free  through #influenster and will absolutely purchase again.,2
Gives a natural glow but you do have to use it almost daily because glow fades quickly. I only use it in the morning due to product staining white sheets. I would not use product past and year—it started giving me hives once it reached the year mark. I have naturally olive skin and the dark serum works great.,1
"This incredible leaves my lips super hydrated and with a very natural color, they look beautiful.  It lasts me a long time.  I’m going to look for other shades because this Fresh Plum looks very nice. Gifted by Fresh",2
"This is a pretty good moisturizer for the under eyes and have seen my skin looking very smooth and glowy. The only thing that bothers me is the smell of this product. It smells strong to me because I am very sensitive to scent. I only really smell it in the first 5-10 minutes of applying it though. Overall, I would reccomend it to people with dry skin like me and if you want to make your skin look a lot more nicer.",1
They smell great and they feel nice and cool. Are they better than a less expensive drugstore brand? I don’t know.,1
"I tried it as one of the VIB samples and I could see an immediate difference in the tone of my skin versus the drug store brand I had been using-not so much in the brightness of my skin as the name implies but more in the tightening and lifting aspect. My skin looked closer to how it looks after a mild chemical peel minus the redness and as I’ve kept using it it seems to maintain the appearance. It’s also much lighter in feel and absorbs into my skin much better than the drug store brand I was using, that brand although not bad did seem to leave a light film on my oily skin. With Caudalie, there is no film and it doesn’t cause me to break out. If it keeps working like this, I will keep using it.",2
I usually am not one to splurge on a face wash but I was lured to this with the Pride packaging this summer.  I have been very impressed with it for my combination (oily t-zone) sensitive skin.  My skin feels cleaned and balanced but not stripped. Scent is minimal/non-offensive which is also a plus.  I don’t regularly wear heavy makeup so can’t speak to hardcore makeup removal.  I’ve used this nightly and still have half a bottle left after 4 months of use so a little goes a long way.  I will very likely repurchase and am excited to try the rest of the line.,2
"Not very moisturizing at all, even on my oily skin. More like a (kind of) tightening serum? Smells nice, has a nice texture, but doesn’t provide good moisturizing (insufficient emollients I think).",0
"Love this products it’s so hydrating, smell delicious, always rebuying it!",2
"Very nice scent, I use just a few drops to work into the ends of my shoulder length hair. In addition to protecting my hair, it also makes it dry faster. I rub what’s left on my hands into my elbows and any other dry area. Most important recommendation is to use it sparingly until you see how it interacts with you hair. I used too much the first time and it made my hair feel a little oily, especially the bangs. But it’s a great product and I’ll buy it again when I finish this first bottle.",1
"I had the chance to test the new Guerlain Abeille Royale advance Youth watery oil from Guerlain Paris.  I received this product for free from Influencer in exchange of my honest review.First, I have to say that the lovely bottle is a beauty by itself, chic and luxurious.  Really love the design.Second, the richness of the oil and the micro-beads are amazing on my dry skin.  I use it morning and night for more then 2 weeks. I feel that my skin is hydrated and smoother day after day.  Love the smell right away at my first use.  It is not to strong.  Easy to apply on the skin with the dropper.  I saw good results after few days.  My skin is glowing.  The only little downfall I could find, is that it’s a little bite sticky, but seriously, nothing that will stop me to buy it again and again.",2
Wow! Makes your lips feel so soft! I have super chapped cracked lips all year round and this helps soften them and they look glossy! Stays on pretty long for a glossy balm. Smells great not overpowering!,2
"Purchased especially to help reduce eliminate pores. Want them gone! Aging skin, unfortunately more pores :(   Sucks. Don’t have massive amount of pores nor large pores but pores none the less that I do not like! Applied nightly for approximately four weeks. Stopped using for about for about 1-2 weeks because I thought this product was not working at all to target reduce pores. During that time not using good genes saw/realized that my pores were more visible without this treatment acid. Astonishing. So I started using it again nightly. My experience, based on stopping use leading to pores more visible, works! I can’t say that I saw a visible decrease in lines though. But I am more seasoned! Perhaps with continued use will help with smoothing lines in addition to decreased pores. Will look into purchasing the luna oil for additional help. Cocktailing.",1
"I received a 7 day trail from influenster of this serum in exchange for my honest review. I have a pretty set skincare routine but I’m always willing s to try different stuff to help my skin, especially serums. I loved the texture & the scent of this serum, which is always something I look for after ingredients. I have sensitive skin so I was a little disappointed to see that it contained mineral oil, but I was still excited to try it! I did notice lightening in my hyper pigmentation, but I feel I would have to use at least half a bottle or a whole bottle to see aging benefits! Turmeric was a big plus in the ingredients for me. It was my first clarins product & I’m excited to try more from this brand!",1
I’m in love with my skin it’s so soft after using this amazing product! Hands down one of my favorites!,2
"Sure-shot for clearing up congested skin on my face, chest and back.",2
I adore this product!! It feels very silly and hydrating on the skin. I feel like it really does calm my skin down. I’m so excited to see how this helps my skins barrier over time! The bottle is gorgeous as well.,2
I am OBSESSED with the packaging of this product because it’s mess free. This gave me the hydration I needed and I can even see a difference in my fine lines. I prefer to use it at night but I have used it under makeup and it worked beautifully!,2
"I purchased this based off of some research I had done on Argan Oil.  I’ve been using this product daily and am loving the results.  Not only has this made the skin softer in the area of the scar, it has started to reduce the visibility of the scar.  I will continue to use this and look forward to hopefully even more reduction in the visibility of my scar.",2
"I love this product! My cuticles get super dry in winter, so I put this on my cuticles at night before I go to sleep. When I wake up, voila! nice and soft. And the same for my lips too! However, you do have to get used to the scent.",2
"Absolutely adore the way this cleanser lathers and leaves my skin SO soft afterward. While I love the glass bottle, the small white plastic cap broke when I was screwing it on tightly. Now I have to keep it in a plastic bag but besides that I LOVE this cleanser and already bought another bottle before finishing the first!",1
"I love hair, make up and beauty products but I’m a total skin care freak and have tried almost everything Sephora and most other stores have. I have been using this cream for about 3 years now and it is the BEST night cream on the market. I buy almost all of my skin care and make up from Sephora and this is one of the only products I purchased else where so I am THRILLED that Sephora is now carrying Origins products, especially this amazing cream!!!!!Love the natural ingredient list, no parabens or other icky preservatives. This cream is my wonder product and every one of my friends (with varying skin types) who has used it at my place immediately goes out and buys it, no joke. It’s thick and creamy with a somewhat minty herbal scent that is divine, but not over kill. It’s very moisturizing, but not greasy at all and your skin literally glows in the morning.Smooth it onto clean skin with your finger tips, I use a nickel sized amount for my whole face but see what works best for you. This is my one of my top five can’t live without beauty products, it does WONDERS for your skin! The jar lasts me about 3 months so it’s a GREAT deal for such an amazing product. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!",2
"Simply hydrates without clogging pores. I swirl 1-3 drops into my face cream before applying it. This is the perfect oil for skin that is acne prone. I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily, oily nose/chin, but still get so dry in some areas that it hurts and this oil has been a lifesaver.",2
"Sometimes, when I see the word “retexturizing,“ I either get slightly alarmed, or expect miracles. I went into using this thinking it would help smooth my skin- and it actually did. The few bumps I had were visible less than half the original size the next day. The dryness and flakes were gone off my forehead, too. Very gentle and felt great on. Skin looked awesome the next day, only needed a small amount of mask too.",2
"My favorite way to use this mask is as a primer- I just take a small amount and use it after my moisturizer, before foundation. It gets rid of your dry patches, so foundation goes on way smoother. Also I’ll leave it in the fridge in the morning, so when I get back from work- I can use it as a cooling mask. Super relaxing and moisturizing!! 10/10 would recommend :)",2
"I got this in a small size from boxing day with C brightning cream. This products actully worked on reduce dark spot from acne and some sun spot. I would used apply sunscreen in the day time cuz it will helped that no new dark spot coming from the sun. Don’t forget, you can get sun in the winter.",2
"This is the best eye cream ever!! Not only does it hide my inevitable dark circles (going to school full-time and working part-time), but it is also the only thing that keeps my eczema on my eye at bay. I usually get flare-ups whenever I’m stressed or during the winter when my skin gets a little more dry, but once I started applying this twice a day, I don’t get flare-ups anymore!!",2
"This does seem to help diminish my dark, under eye circles a bit. But it did also create a pimple under my eye though after about two or three weeks, so that kind of sucked. I have sensitive, acne prone skin, but under eye pimples are not the norm for me. I would recommend this product if you know your skin isn’t so sensitive.",1
"Needed some makeup wipes and these were cheap and cheerful. Little did I know I would like them so much.  My typical brand is Purity, but these are great for travel and the ROI is much better.  I have sensitive skin and didn’t have any issues using this product.",2
"I loved this exfoliator. My skin felt so smooth after I used this product. I also loved how the beads weren’t too harsh on my skin. Which is why I’m also reluctant to try physical scrubs. The beads are so small, it doesn’t feel like it’s tearing my skin like other physical exfoliators. My skin looked brighter and felt smooth after one use! I love that it also has glycolic acid to even further exfoliate my skin! If you’re looking for a great, clean exfoliating scrub that is both physical and chemical, this is the one for you!",2
This is one of the only products that I have used that is GENTLE and takes off ALL of my makeup. I have VERY sensitive skin and this does the job without irritation. Bonus points: smells good! Highly recommend.,2
"the only cleanser that doesn’t dry out my face! I have eczema and oily skin which makes it really difficult to find products that will clean enough while also not drying my skin out really bad. This is great for sensitive skin, eczema, and whatever other weird things my skin decides to do.",2
Really enjoying this toner. It gives just the right amount of sting. Smells amazing and leaves my face and neck feeling soft. Love that it’s all natural as well. Would definitely recommend.,1
Absolutely the best lip balm ever. I have bought this lip balm several times now and always use the entire tin.,2
"I got a small size of this cleanser from a FAB holiday set over a year ago, and haven’t used any other face cleanser since. The little 2 oz tube lasted me months, because a pea-sized amount is enough for my whole face. My skin is dry and sensitive, and this causes no redness or other irritation. This and the Ultra Repair Cream are staples of my skincare routine.",2
"SK-II so happy I got to sample this Essence/toner for review.  I did receive sample sizes for free to give an honest review.  I loved the Essence and am happy to say it is great for the week supply given. I unfortunately did not think it was a product I would continue to use. I am super sensitive and suffer from dry skin. This product was not a successful one for me.  I also am reviewing the skin power eye cream and the face cream. I was supplied the eye cream sample for free trial. I didn’t notice a strong overwhelming scent.  It did glide on smoothly.  Soak in fast but again didn’t notice a difference with the amount of product supplied.   I am hopeful others live this product.  The Skin power cream has a light fragrance.  Very creamy. Soaked in well. Delightful and am happy to report it didn’t make my super sensitive dry skin act up. I received it for a review, free sample.",2
"This product did brightness my skin, but the sample size was a little awkward to use since it came out so quick being a serum, it would definitely work better with the dropper. Smell is good but not too strong and it didn’t make my skin feel pily like some others can",1
I received these products for free from Influenster and belif in exchange for my honest review. “ The lips are a part of our body that we hardly ever pay much attention to.  But they really go through a lot of exposure to all the different climates and we need to hydrate them and keep them clean of dead cells.,2
"As a guy who suffers from redness and has rather fair skin, I hoped this would neutralize and even-out my skin’s appearance. I’m giving it two stars because it does a good job of easing some of the redness, but I ultimately looked like I was heading off to clown college—complete with white face paint. The result is a really flat, monotone, whitened appearance that looks like I dipped my face in a bunch of foundation. I tried applying it sparingly after initially doing a heavy, full face (my goodness what a shock that was, lol) but the effect was still unsettling and artifical-looking. What’s more, my redness still worked its way through, although certainly reduced. I would say folks who wear makeup on top of this product will be able to create a more human-like appearance, but if you don’t plan on wearing anything to soften the impact, get comfortable looking like a Spirit Halloween Store ghost. Had to return it.",0
I’m not usually into Lancome products but I received a deluxe sample of this and tried it out. I was surprised but how much it improved my skin in just a week. It is extremely hydrating and easy to apply. I feel like it reduces redness and even helped create more even skin tone. I’ve already ordered the full size version. It’s expensive but you only need a few drops daily so it lasts for months.,2
"I picked this stuff up without reading any reviews or anything. I just saw “thirst quenching“ and decided this might be great for my dry flaky fake in the winter months. Sure enough, I use this bad boy before bed and leave it on and wake up feeling SO moisturized. I love ittttttt!!!",2
"I have combo acne-prone skin and man this cleanser has worked wonders on me. It has become a tried and true item in my routine for the last two years, highly recommend!!",2
I’ve never thought that removing waterproof mascara could be so easy! I love it!,2
"I used this product in conjunction with the violet-c brightening serum for several weeks and have not noticed any significant changes. I added it to my normal routine, which is already pretty thorough, so that could be why I haven’t seen any changes. The packaging is gorgeous and it definitely feels like you’re using an expensive product. O received the two Tatcha products for free from Influenster, and I don’t think I will repurchase due to how expensive it is without much impact to my skin.",1
"This product is actually really amazing. It gives you a wonderful natural glow and your skin looks beautiful with it! However, it made me break out within a day of using it. I double cleanse everyday and my usual sunscreen has never made me breakout. I tried it several different days apart and the same result happen. It’s a shame because it really does make your skin beautiful.",1
"I am a huge Tarte fan! I was so excited when The Rainforest of the Sea line came out. The drink of H20 hydrating boost is one of the best moisturizers i have ever used! I love the smell and how refreshing it feels, it is perfect to use morning or night. You can even put it on over your makeup if you happen to get dry spots during the day!",2
"First, I just repurchased my second big one -after a month shy of 3 years! It LASTS and is the only expensive skin care I use. I got a trial size years ago from IPSY and I loved it. It feels great when you put it on. If your skin care has dried out the skin around your eyes, it makes it feel way better. I also always try to sell it (like get them to buy it themselves) to my friends bc it is AMAZING for when you’re hungover and actually have to adult that day- very moisturizing and it helps wake you up.100% love it and I started using it when I was 19, so I don’t use it for the age lines, but it’s still great even if that’s not why you’re buying it! P.S. you really do NOT need a lot. A little go a verrrry long way and you only need an itsy-bitsy amount for it to cover your under eye, eye lid, and side eye.",2
"I am 33 years old and this is the first time in my life since before puberty, that my skin is totally clear, soft and flawless, thanks to the Ole Henrickson Balancing products. I use the entire system twice daily but only use a minimal amount of the moisturizer (about a pea size drop). I live in Arizona and this doesn’t dry my face out, keeps me oil free. I had combination skin but this stuff changed that for the first time ever. My oily tzone has vanished and I feel confident going out without makeup on. This toner has massively shrunk my pores with continued use, and I no longer get oily when I’m out, even in direct sunlight and 105 degree dry desert heat. In addition to using this kit, I also switched to the IT cosmetics CC cream in lieu of using any foundation or makeup. I also use the orange Glamglow brightening mask once per week. Since the AZ summer, I have added a hyalauronic acid serum to my regimen after the toner and right before the moisturizer. This may help some of you who feel that the product is too drying. Just remember that none of these are instant miracle products for everyone but I’ve found what works for me. Also, drinking plenty of water, 8 glasses per day, seems to activate the hyalauronic acid moisturizing and plumping properties. For proper results, make sure you use this twice daily! Stick with it for at least three months before you give up. I wouldn’t have realized the power this has if I went by my first week to month results. You won’t be disappointed.",2
So I am oily and live in the south this product can get a little shiny if used under an oil based make up it is really better for a boat or a beach day when you will not be wearing any or much make up. It does have a very light fragrance and feels a bit like a make up primer which is nice.,1
"It’s lovely, it has such a nice brightening effect on skin. Smells very herbal, almost like hay, but in a nice way? Took away a star for price and the fact that it can irritate more delicate skin- keep away from your eyes!",1
"I absolutely love this cream. From the title I didn’t realize it was a moisturizer but one swipe and oh my gosh! So nurturing on my skin. Like smooth butter. A nice thick consistency to it, not runny! All the while, alot going a long way. My skin soaked this up.",2
"I received this cleanser free from influenster for my honest opinion. My opinion is my own and not swayed at all, this cleanser is gentle but effective, it not only deep cleans but removes my dry dead skin without irritating my sensitive skin. I’m a retin-a user and normally clean my face with a drugstore gentle facial cleanser and stop all together after using this. it doesn’t react with my topical cream, plus it removes the product completely. I’m a huge fan and I’ve alrws y bought a full size from Sephora as a back up so I never run out.",2
Feels so different than any other moisturizer!! Really lives up to all the hype around it! love!!!,2
"I use this morning and night with my Clarisonic, and followed up with Moisture Surge moisturizer. The combination of those 3 works wonders, my skin feels supple and healthy, and no longer looks parched or flaky. Other moisturizers/face washes leave me dry by the end of the day and verging on shiny/oily, but this never does. I’ve been using this product for over a year straight and I won’t go with anything else.",2
"I love all the Innisfree products that I’ve tried, this mask included. It’s budget friendly compared to other masks from Sephora and it’s so effective. It really does a great job of clearing your pores, I would definitely give it a try!",2
Such an amazing cleanser! Exfoliates gently and leaves your skin feeling so soft. Just a little bit goes a long way!,2
I’ve finished THREE of this lip treatment. It’s a MUST HAVE! It does moisturize & protect my lips. I also use it as a primer for lip colour.,2
I absolutely love this mask! It only took using a sample one night and I immediately put it in my cart the next morning. It takes very little to cover my whole face. Unlike other night face masks it doesn’t feel sticky or heavy so it’s easy to sleep in. After I rinse on the morning my skin feels so soft and hydrated. Additional benefit is how incredible it smells!,2
"I have been using various eye creams/gels/serums for several years. This one exceeded my expectations, but I wanted to give it a fair shot before reviewing. From the first week, I noticed a big change in my undereyes! They are much brighter and moisturized. I didn’t notice a huge difference in my fine lines, but waking up without big, dark, puffy bags under my eyes is wonderful! I definitely recommend! A little goes a long way!",2
"Although I only used it in the store, immediately I saw a difference in my skin. I had some scarring and pigmentation on my face around my chin and my cheeks. My face was very bright I have ordered it online. I love this brand, they’re products are worth your money.",2
"Received this product with the box opened. Nothing looked like it leaked, but sitting upright now it does not look like there is a full bottle of product in there. Works well enough, but bad, sketchy packaging.",1
"Great lip moisturizer for day and night, it’s clear and long lasting. I like to use it an hour before applying my lipstick so I get an even and smooth application. Works great and definitely something I carry everywhere!",2
Two completely fabulous and awesome products! I’ve been thinking about trying for a long time but was worried about the spend and was unsure about committing however... These two are worth every penny; they make a visible difference to the feel and texture of my skin. Overall; great value. Definite repurchase on the horizon!,2
"This is my favorite daytime moisturizer of all time and I’ve tried a lot, some more expensive than this one. Nothing glows like this one does, it really makes my skin feel good and look glowy, not greasy.",2
"I’ve been using this mask as a moisturizer, primer before makeup !!!!! It makes me feel so relaxing every time i put it on. Keep my skin hydrated all day long!!! THIS IS THE BEST MULTITASK PRODUCT EVER!",2
"This cream is light, and doesn’t sink into the skin. If you’re over 30, or need hydration, forget it. There are so many wonderful creams out there, I don’t get what the hype is about this one.",0
"I had to switch my routine for summer because my current face routine was not enough for oily skin during 120 weather & as soon as I started this face wash &toner my acne started to calm down. I also bought a serum at the same time unfortunately I stopped the serum because I first thought this toner was the one breaking me out. Turned out the serum was the one that my skin wasn’t liking.  Iv been using the toner only & my pores do look smaller without the serum. I guess I can’t use serums. But this cleanser, toner, and cream are my future summer routine from now on! Buying this again",2
"Complimentary from demroalogica, I have really joyed this powder exfoliants you mix it with a little or a little more water make it the consistency that you want and it’s a great cleanser. It works great I got seven single packages I’ve used them all I haven’t noticed a huge difference in my skin but I have noticed that it exfoliates very gently",2
"This is hands-down the best exfoliating scrub I’ve ever used. Yes, it is expensive, but if you only use it once or twice a week, it should last you for several months. It leaves my face soft and smooth. I’ve never had any issues with redness/irritation.",2
"This is great for purging pores and drying up my blemishes. I recommend you use this at night, not too often. My face gets really flushed after use.",1
"I bought the small size first and after giving it a try I immediately bought the larger size. This product is simply amazing. My skin feels satiny soft. Love, love, love it!",2
Good moisturizer however I didn’t see great results. I did however notice my skin never got dry in the winter and never chapped. This product did a great job of preventing skin issues I usually encounter.,1
Been using this for 3 weeks now after ditching a cleanser with salicylic acid and let me tell you this is so much more effective on my acne than my previous cleanser and way less harsh. I honestly love this product so much and can see a huge difference in the texture of my skin and my breakouts are almost all completely gone. 10/10 recommend,2
"I bought this because people were comparing it to my holy grail lip treatment, the but beauty agave one, and I was disappointed. I dont think it works even half as good! BUT this is super cheap and you get a ton of product, so because of that I don’t regret the purchase and will use. I fing it to be just a basic balm. one thing I have to say is I hate the packaging!! SO bulky!",1
This company tests on animals and is not cruelty free. Spend the extra $4 and purchase Tatcha’s “The Kissu Lip Mask.“ Better quality product from a much better company.,0
I originally bought the small bottle of this product. I used it pretty quickly (about 2-3 weeks) and had to get more. It is the perfect moisturizer for me. It is so hydrating and I love putting something so natural onto my skin.,2
The soft side is really nice but for at least my skin the exfoliating side can irritate my skin pretty easily.,1
Does a good job cleansing and removing make up. It’s gentle on my sensitive skin and fragrance free I believe so I love the product.,1
"I’ve really enjoyed using this product. The packaging is easily used and stored. The scent is faint but refreshing. While I appreciate the Niacinimide being one of the most prominent ingredients, I do see that this product has alcohol in it, which means I will not be purchasing because of the long term effects it has on the skin. If you do not mind alcohol has an ingredient, I would recommend this product as a great niacinimide serum that will likely do well with acne and/or acne scars.",1
This is the first eye cream I’ve used and I’m glad this was my introduction because now it’s a staple. I don’t enjoy an skincare routine but I’m in my early thirties so unfortunately it’s time to tackle it. This eye cream is a delight to put on! It’s so silky and there is no greasy residue or scent. It makes my eye area feel so smooth and I’ve noticed reduced lines and no dark circles under my eyes while using this product. I highly recommend this eye cream! I received this product free from Influenster and Estée Lauder.,2
"I hate writing negative reviews. But for this eye cream I don’t get why this is so highly rated. If your skin is even remotely wet or had product on it, the cream will just sit on your skin and it kind of separates and just feels weird. It’s super thick which is nice but for the money there are better creams out there. I will be returning.",0
"Since this is recommended for acne prone skin I tried it out, the packaging- as with all herbivore products is great. But this broke me out so bad, I tried to stick with it to see if my skin just needed some time to adjust but holy; it just didn’t. It took a couple weeks after for my skin to clear back up. Definitely a miss for my acne prone skin.",0
"This is so great for spot treatment! I put it on pimples forming, pimples already formed, and pimples popped. This helps with all stages of pimples! It helps prevent new ones from getting bigger and helps calm popped pimples. I put it on at night and let it dry before for about 5-10 minutes before going to bed, then I wash it off in the morning.",2
I loved this lip therapy....the best all.,2
"If you’re looking for a simple, clean moisturizer that you can add to your routine without a second thought, this is for you. It’s unscented, it absorbs quickly, and the ingredients are *chefs kiss* - it’s super gentle but definitely plumps the skin. I used mine mostly in the morning (sometimes at night, too, if I wanted something lighter), and it wore well under makeup. Excited to try more YTTP products!",2
"Perfect summer moisturizer for oily skin! Light, non-greasy formula, with a pleasant soft scent. Best I have found for keeping the shine at bay.",2
"I received this as a sample from PINCHme. I have a lot of blackheads that are hard to get rid of. Although it doesn’t take out all the blackheads, it does help the ones on the surface. Overall i liked this product. Would recommend and would buy it.",2
"I’ve been using TLC for about a week and I really like it so far. I have combination and sensitive skin, and this product has not irritated my skin at all. I’ve noticed that it is quite hydrating so far, but I think it’s too early to see any  of the other results. It’s worth the price tag!",2
"This face wash held up to its name. It’s extremely frothy and a great lather in combination with my Clarisonic. I use this face wash at night or before a face mask because I feel like it gives an exfoliating effect considering my skin is really matte by the end of it, therefore a perfect base for my creams and serums! It really does balance the skin and I would recommend this product to people with oily and combination skin. If you’re dry, I would probably stay clear from this one. Super mattifying!",1
"I purchased this from Sephora to help with my dried winter skin. And it’s been an awesome addition!! My skin looks plumper, radiant and even my fine lines are less visible!! Thanks Sephora for adding The Ordinary to your site! Can’t wait for it to be restocked so that I can stock up as my husband is obsessed with it too!",2
This product was sent by Supergoop for review purposes only. I really liked the natural finish of this sunscreen tint. It definitely gives a nice glow without leaving the skin greasy. It applied pretty easy too!,2
"Received this in my Sephora play box. I have oily and acne prone skin . It removed my makeup but didn’t get rid of the oil. Do the cotton pad test, gently wipe or Pat your face after washing it with this you’ll see... Great thing I didn’t get stuck with the big bottle",0
This helps eliminate my dark circles and puffiness. It also is keeping the wrinkles away. I love it and have bought it over and over. I would recommend it to anyone!,2
"I have YTP. products for years, I love them all, but this is my go-to moisturizer and really helps my skin stay and feel supple, clean and clear!",2
This water cream is absolutely amazing - I’m totally in love with it! It goes on smooth and doesn’t leave a sticky residue.  It leaves my face feeling hydrated and fresh - I use it every morning and evening as part of my facial routine.,2
Really liking the way this makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth without leaving a think slimy feeling on my face.,1
"I was gifted by Sunday Riley to test & review this product and I have to say, I am impressed at how quickly I saw visible results with my skin. This lactic acid treatment serum can be used as a treatment where you rinse it off after 15 minutes, which is recommended for those with more sensitive skin, or if you have more tolerable skin like myself, you can leave it on as part of your skincare routine. This product is a great chemical exfoliator that removes dead skin cells, leaving your skin smoother, blemish free and brighter in appearance. I like to use this product during my nighttime routine and I highly recommend wearing SPF the following day (even though SPF is recommended to be worn everyday!).",2
I’ve been using this product for years now and love it. It definitely helps prevent breakouts when used daily.,2
Once you have used Shiseido cotton there is no going back to regular cotton. It’s not possible. They are just too good,2
I really love this product but my bestie and I both got these at the same time and she got 4 samples of the same wipes for free and didn’t have to pay at all and then I had to pay for the whole packed of wipes like really come on.,1
"I’m not a huge moisturizer person (I prefer oils) but this moisturizer is everything. It’s light, subtle, and moisturizing without being overly oily or greasy. My skin absorbs this so quickly and makes my skin feel firm and supple. I actually enjoy the packaging because you can control how much of the product is released without having to dip your fingers into a gunky jar; bacteria can’t enter like it does with a twist-open-lid jar and the product stays clean. It isn’t overly fragrant or have a chemical scent so that’s also a huge plus for me. Truly another home run for Drunk Elephant and I highly recommend this cream!",2
My skin felt stripped after using this and it made me break out very bad.,0
"I’m surprised by how much I like this! I’ve always worried that the peel/pilling type exfoliants were gimmicky and not actually doing what I need them to. Yo Glow proved otherwise! It leaves my skin baby soft without feeling like I have I ran my face though a belt sander. I love the smell, I can’t it my finger on it. Almost like jasmine but not quite. Maybe Lily of the Valley? Regardless, this product makes me happy!",2
"I have combination skin, and in general need hydration and a great moisturizer to hopefully help even my skin tone. At face value the packaging led me to believe this is exactly what I needed. However upon trying this was extremely thick, and had a weird silicone texture that prevented my skin from soaking it in. I can’t even objectively say how this worked overtime because the sample I received was so small and contained so little that there was only two maybe three uses in it. I’ve used other Estée Lauder products before and loved them. This just fell short:",0
"Ok, so I have not bought this... YET. But after reading so many reviews on this and how incredible it was, I went in Sephora and asked for a sample. GIRL, LET ME TELL YOU!!!!! I added just a tiny bit to my face and left it on over night, I woke up the next morning and washed it off to reveal soft non textured skin!!!!!! Being dry and acne prone is tough enough but having texture is the worst because I can’t ever seem to get rid of it! This did for at least a few hours and my face was incredibly soft.!!! I will be purchasing!!! P.s. Since I’m dry this did dry me out just a bit so I had to add just a little bit more hydration into my skin. But overall result so worth it! The consultant recommended I use this twice a week since I’m dry",2
I’ve been using this product for 3 months now and my skin has changed in the absolute best way! My acne is minimized my pores are minimized over all skin is soft as a dream. LOVE! :),2
So far so good! I’ve been suffering from hormonal acne recently and it’s slowly drying out my break outs. I have very sensitive skin and it hasn’t caused a reaction. It doesn’t have any scent and leaves my face feeling clean.,2
"It does what it says and I desperately want to love it, but the formula is too greasy and clogs my pores if I use it too often. If you have acne-prone skin I wouldn’t recommend this product.",1
"Definitely a 1-2 times a week type of product.  It works and faded my hyperpigmentation. my skin is definitely smoother as well.  dried out my skin a bit, so definitely use a good moisturizer",1
The consistency of this moisturizer does not feel heavy at all and is great for those with dry skin! It is very hydrating and is perfect to use for a night cream. I just love the way it absorbs into my skin and makes it feel radiant,2
I love the entire Tatcha line.  However the essence plumping skin softener is my new favorite from Tatcha.  It feels like plain water but it really pumps the skin and prepare you skin for make up.  This plumping serum should be used right after washing your face.,2
"Girl lemme tell you This cream is like the holy grailMy skin is sensitive and dry and I put this on and my skin is like baby soft without feeling oily and it’s soaked into my skin so perfectly. Like when ya girl wakes up, I look super  crusty but I have to get out the door fast, I put this on the night before, I wake up and I look like a solid 10 out of 10, fresh, moisturized, naturally snatched, and ready to slay the day.Thank me later ladies",2
I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin even with the scent. The smell is very nice and light. It does what its suppose and removes makeup and debris. It has two sides one exfoliating and the other smooth. i prefer the smooth side. The exfoliating side is a little too rough.  Overall i would buy again if price point was cheaper and maybe came with more skin benefits.,1
"I received this product for free from Influenster and Charlotte Tilbury in exchange for my honest review! My usual cream is Confidence in a Cream, and they are pretty comparable to me if you have tried that! I like Charlotte’s a bit more as the rose scent is lovely, I wish I could breathe it in all day! The cream is thick and absorbs well, it is an excellent moisturizer, but doesn’t keep you oily. If I can find it on sale, I will buy, as the price does scare me a tad.",1
This is awesome. If you have a problem with clogged pores this product is for you. It’s great alone or you can add a product like Bobbi Brown’s polishing beads for more exfoliating power. It’s great for daily use.,2
"I received this item in my Influenster box and I was SO excited - felt like my birthday   Christmas combined. I have never tried this product but heard amazing things. First, I love the packaging - straight to the point, no nonsense, no illusion of how much product is actually in it. I personally love that! Secondly, it is VERY thick - which was intimidating at first. I had to learn that a little goes a long way, and to make sure my skin is patted completely dry before using (that include finger tips if applying by hand!) Once I figured that out, I was able to use the perfect amount of eye treatment to make the areas around my eyes feel extremely hydrated and just, honestly, luxurious! I love using this before bed and I feel so refreshed when I apply it on in the morning. I have now been using significantly less makeup and yet getting a ton of compliments on the condition of my skin. I barely hear the “You look really tired today“ comment I used to receive a lot going into work. Definitely purchasing this product once I’m done with my free sample because it is going to be worth every single penny.",2
Rosacea sufferers pay attention this is the cream you’ve been desperate for - improves redness and calms skin down significantly. Well worth the price!,2
"Use this every night. Tried to switch to other creams/oils over the years but keep coming back to this product. Great product for dry/ sensitive skin. I moved abroad and the air is full of pollutants, but this keeps my skin glowing. Can be used as a pick-me-up to dry skin during the day or on cuticles. Awesome multi-tasker for those who hate lots of products.",2
"I have always had problems with dry, flaky skin that gets shiny and oily an hour or so after moisturizing. A friend recommended this moisturizer to me, and I’m so glad that I tried it! I can feel it being immediately absorbed into my skin instead of sitting on top and making me feel greasy soon afterward.It sooths my super-sensitive, dry skin and leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized without turning oily and shiny later. I also love that it’s fragrance-free and allergy-tested.If you have combination/oily skin that’s sensitive and dry after cleansing, this is the perfect product for you.",2
It’s decent for the price but honestly there are better cleansing balms out there. I realized w this product that I prefer an oil anyways.,1
Best eye cream I have tried 2022 and I’m bringing into the 2023. This helps with moisturizing my very dry under eye. I love to use it during my night time routine I wake up feeling amazing. Even when I use during am my eye makeup looks great,2
"This was recommended to me by a sephora employee. Since I started taking accutane, my lips have become very dry and cracked. I couldn’t even wear matte lipsticks since I was so self conscious. I’ve tried all types of lip balms and mask, and this is the one product that has helped me heal my cracked,dry  lips.  Plus it smells so good like bubblegum.",2
I use a handful of products from The Ordinary but I recently added this toner and I am so glad I did.  I thought my skin was soft before using this... now it feels like porcelain!,2
"Lovely texture but gave me cystic acne. I received a deluxe size as part of my VIB birthday gift and finally had the chance to try this cream. Glided on beautifully and felt great, moisturizer without being heavy. But about a week after using it I got a few cystic acne bumps, which I never get, and that was the only change to my skincare routine or environment in a long while. I really wanted to love this cream, but I’m sticking with my Belif True Cream.",0
Is the best moisturizing cream I’ve found. I ordered the sample size once and I fell in love with it that I had to purchase this one. It really moistures your skin without leaving the face oily. I haven’t seen improved in pores but I just love how hydrate my skin feels throughout the day,2
"This is a dream product! My skin is normal to dry, and it leaves it feeling cleansed without feeling stripped. I have never washed my face so fast! I only ever use waterproof mascara (my eyes water frequently, sensitive to light and I am a crier), so when I am done massaging my face and neck with the oil, I gently rub my eyes and eyelashes, too. It gets every last bit off! Best to follow the directions. Dry face and hands, massage into your skin, and then I recommend using warm water to rinse. It melts everything away. I love this product and have been telling everyone about it.",2
This product is very hydrating and left my face feeling fresh.,1
"I received a deluxe sample size of this product in a past Sephora PLAY! box, and I loved the way it felt. I have oily skin, and this cream left my skin feeling fresh and moisturized without that gross, heavy feeling that a lot of moisturizers have. My pores weren’t clogged, my sensitive skin wasn’t breaking out. It was great! I bought the larger size, and I was in heaven for the first two weeks or so. That was when the packaging became a serious issue for me. The cream comes with a little plastic spatula so you’re not constantly dipping your fingers into the jar and contaminating the product, but I still noticed a definite change in the quality of the product as time went on. I have no idea why so many skincare brands continue to package their products in clear glass jars like this. When you expose a product to light and air, the formulation is going to change over time. This wasn’t a problem for me when I was using a small size of this product, because I reached the bottom of the jar before it could really change too much. When I was using the 2oz jar, it was a big problem. By the time I got to the last quarter of the jar, my skin was reacting pretty badly to this product. I was having issues with oil and shine midway through the day, I was breaking out more frequently, and I wasn’t getting that fresh, light moisture I loved so much about the product at first. If you’re considering getting a small size of this product, I say go for it, especially if you have oily skin. But definitely save your money when it comes to the larger size.",1
"This is truly a copy cat of the japanese brand Cure Natural, Natural Aqua Gel. It does the exact same thing for a lot less. Meaning, this is the “lergest size“ they offer whiel I switched to the Aqua Gel, I get a lot more for the same prize. The way Huda used it on her instagram is a lot different how it’s marketed to be. You’re really buying the brand name, not the product. This is a hard pass.",0
"I absolutely love Rosebud Salve. When my lips are really chapped, it can always bring it back to normal. You can also use it on other parts of your body. I highly recommend this for anyone that is suffering from dry lips and skin.",2
i used this once and i my skin immediately felt smoother and clean. and a plus it smelt AMAZING.,2
"Just want to add that I use the Sunday Riley slip clay cleaner and I absolutely love it! The only cleanser I’ve ever repurchased. Has had a big role in minimizing my breakouts. So I decided to try the oil as well. I’m prone to painful cystic acne around my chin and cheeks. I had no active breakouts when I started using the oil. About 2 days later I had 4 large breakouts come to the surface. I know that probably sounds bad but if I didn’t have this oil, these breakouts would take weeks to surface and heal. They recommend using the oil 2-3x a week to avoid purging and working your way up. I was using it every day 2x a day. But the breakouts are shrinking so fast, I expect they’ll be completely gone within a couple of days. I have a good feeling about this oil. When you apply it is very oily, but quickly sinks in. The smell isn’t great but I really don’t mind. I bought the smaller version just to try and I expect it will last a really long time!",2
I really like this exfoliator. It isn’t harsh with its gritty texture but is also super effective. I equate it to a light sand paper if you will. It works well but I think is too much money.,1
"Eh, it’s Alright. Honestly I don’t have anything great or poor to say about it. The Lala Retro is way better in my opinion. This has a gel like feelTo it, which isn’t bad, but for me I enjoy the creamy texture of lala.",1
"I’ve been obsessed with Jack Black lip balm for 12 years, but I’ve found a new love. I use it twice a day and it’s incredible! (Don’t worry Jack, I still keep you around in my purse.)",2
I absolutely love this moisturizer. It’s lightweight enough yet super hydrating. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave you looking greasy. Will repurchase.,2
"I do not often write bad reviews, but this product has the oddest smell.  I ordered three products from The Ordinary.  I have tried mixing them and using one at a time and the they all have the worst scent... I went in to a free standing ordinary store and smelled this rose oil and it seemed to not be as strong but after leaving the store I had the same experience.  It could be my body chemistry that is not mixing well but I will be returning the three products I tried, too bad.",0
It’s ridiculous that this small lip balm is $26. I was lucky enough to not be stupidly Who is money on something so mediocre. I’ve got this for free and used it a few times. I saw no benefits to this at all. If anything my lips felt dryer. The product is very flimsy and doesn’t work well. Only gave two stars because it did smell bad. That’s pretty much it. Sorry not sorry,0
"I LOVE this duo. Most important things to note:1-Buying in this package is cheaper than buying larger sizes individually (I did the math)2-I thought since I have oily/acne prone skin the UFO treatment would be better, but this one is the best.3-Feels amazing and I always wake up with glowing skin. This helped clear up old acne scars and current breakouts, as well as prevent future breakouts. I LOVE it. 4-Good for preventing signs of aging too. I’m 24 years old and was just starting to get a little wrinkle under each eye and this has helped the wrinkles regress and halt their progress!",2
Didn’t like this. The moisturizer is very oily. You get what you pay for I guess,0
"This cleanser left my skin really dry and I have extremely oily skin. I felt that I needed more moisture afterwards with this. I typically don’t like “squeaky clean” feeling skin that’s super dried out.  Left my skin feeling tight.  Though it has a nice travel size, my skin was a mess after using for 2 weeks.",1
"I received a sample of this product via Influenster. The sample was small, but I did notice differences in my fine lines during the time it was used. The texture of my skin was also improved.",2
"I’m 34 and I look younger than my age, and I’d like to keep it that way. I think this will be a great help. It is super thick but doesn’t feel greasy or heavy at all. There is no scent. My face feels supple and smooth.",2
"I really like these and you can’t beat that price. I use this nightly as a toner, after double cleansing and before a serum and moisturizer. There is plenty of product on the pad, enough to amply cover the face. These do smell weird- kind of salty (my boyfriend says like a hot dog), but I have other skin products with that same kind of smell, and it fades soon after its on. These make my skin feel and look good, but I also use a strong weekly acid peel, which makes a bigger difference than these in overall texture and color of my skin. I have repurchased this twice and will continue to use.",2
"I’ve been using this cleanser for over a month now and I really like it! It cleans your skin but it does not leave it dry, it’s gentle and it hasn’t irritated my sensitive skin. The only con for me is the type, you have to put some of the product in your hands and put a lot of water to make it into a type of foam, I don’t think it’s a rich foam, as the brand advertise in the package, it feels like a cream (which is good), but I would prefer a package that already dispense the foam, instead to have to mix it by myself. If you don’t mix it with a lot of water you will feel some granules, which can irritates your skin, so I think they should disclose this better, because the first times I thought this was how it was supposed to be, but then I noticed if I rubbed my hands more I would dissolve all these granules. In general it’s a great product, I love how my skin feels after it and it smells great! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.",1
I have been following the Korean 10 step skin routine for about 6 months and have tried many essences but this is in a league of its own! It makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated. I was lucky enough to get a sample of this from Influenster in exchange for my honest review but I will definitely continue purchasing when I finish up my sample!,2
I got the opportunity to try the Jet Lag Mask from Summer Fridays  and all I got to say it’s amazing my skin feels so soft and moisturized I can see the difference before I started using it and I am very happy with the results that it’s giving me I am a combination skin and tend to get dry from my chin and my chicks but my t-zone it’s very oily and this mask helps me with the oiliness and also moisturizes my dry zone,2
"DO NOT USE. I usually have great, non-picky skin with little issues, and after using it my entire face is red and blotchy. I’ve never had a problem like this before. BEWARE.",0
"I received this product for free from Influenster and Shiseido in exchange for my honest review. This sunscreen is great. It has a nice thin texture that’s easy to spread and has a slight tint. It is lighter than my skintone, so I was worried I’d get the dreaded white cast. But it rubs in and becomes sheer. It moisturized my dry skin nicely and didn’t cake in my fine lines. It also didn’t irritate my sensitive skin nicely, so that’s a win as well! I look forward to continuing to wear this sunscreen. #complimentary #shiseidosuncare @Influenster @Shiseido",2
This product is so great! I used it after I showered and washed my face after a long day and feel so refreshed! Not to mention is smells good too! It goes on smooth and doesn’t leave your face feeling sticky and gross. A little goes a long way so this complimentary sample from Influenster will last me a while. Looking forward to using this product every night.,2
"This is a nice, light feeling moisturizer that applies very well after using the Skinfix cleanser. My face feels moist, not oily or dry. It is probably a good idea to use both products from the same company for best results. The only downside to this product is the packaging. Like some of the other brands, there is an excessive amount of plastic used with this particular style of container and they need to be more environmentally responsible.",1
This works so well on my cystic acne. Great product!,2
"Literally the best moisturizer ever. I’ve been using tretinoin for 6 months and this has really helped am up the hydration, evenness and smoothed texture. Will definitely be repurchasing again and I like that you only need to buy the insert whenever u run out. Seriously love this!!",2
"After using this product I feel like I could tell that my face was more hydrated by feel, but no obvious visible differences. The feeling of hydration was immediate, but again, visibly I just didn’t see a difference. The texture of the cream was nice, smooth, almost gel-like, and I could tell it was hydrating. I can recommend for the hydrating gel, if you’re goal is to feel hydrated, but if you are hoping to see visible hydrating results, I can’t guarantee it will do that based on my experience.Would you recommend it to others? Why? Why not?",1
"This mask is really gentle and super moisturizing! My sensitive skin didn’t react to it, I was really surprised! A lot of masks don’t work for me so I’m really happy this one did! I can’t wait to use this on my flight to Tokyo next month!",2
i personally love this,2
"I live for the lip sleeping mask, so I was hoping this product would be similar. I love the smell of the grapefruit one, but it really leaves my lips more dry after using it. Bummed! Will not likely purchase again.",0
"These work great but they’re so overpriced compared to other brands that work just as well for 1/4 the price. The pore strips are way too uncomfortable but these dots work well. They’re thicker than other brands so you can’t wear them under makeup or during the day but they do absorb from anything that’s open. If it’s just blackheads, they don’t do much more than blotting paper but if it’s a pimple, it keeps bacteria out and helps to dry it out without having to use a clay based treatment like Mario Badescu. They only help with popped white heads",1
Best moisturizing cream I have ever used on my skin! it adds a nice shine and does make my skin look oily at all! it stays on for a long time and works well with any foundation!,2
"Love this lip balm! Very hydrating, soothing and long lasting. Is a must have!",2
Absolutely love this line! Has helped restore balance to my oily-prone skin.,2
Best lip balm I’ve used. I’m a lip balm junkie and this one is worth the price tag! It keeps my lips soft and hydrated so I don’t need to reapply often.,2
The new Dr brandt recovery sleeping mask is awesome after I started using it I can feel the change on my skin it is soft and an it has rediced significantly the redness and signs of irritation on my skin.  I love the testure and the smell. I highly recommend this product!,2
"I’ve been using this eye cream every morning for a few months now and I’m noticing any difference with my under eye area. It is not very hydrating either. I like that it is very affordable, but it didn’t do anything for me.",0
"If u need DEEP exfoliation fast then this is the product for you. One use and nearly all of my cystic acne that was under the surface was above skin. These pads r incredible! And my skin is super sensitive—no irritation. I docked 2 stars for price because the same results can be found with a prescribed retinal/peroxide hybrid from a dermatologist for free, minus the derm costs.",1
This is my all time favorite lip treatment. It simply works better and faster than anything else I have tried. Soothes and heals and no annoying taste or texture.,2
"I love love love this moisturizer. If you love thick creamy moisturizers THIS IS IT!! I have super dry sensitive skin, so I struggle to find a thick moisturizer that doesn’t make me look greasy, but the LaLa is a HOLY GRAIL. It’s pricey, but when you take into consideration the benefits of this moisturizer and how a little goes a long way, its worth it. Personally, it lasts about 5 months for me, and I keep repurchasing it :)",2
I love using this at night after I wash my face. It keeps my skin soft and smooth. If I use it under my foundation it makes me too oily. But I found using it at night helps my skin so much.,2
"This is an okay product. Way too much silicone at the top of the ingredient deck, so this products won’t really get a chance to absorb, just feel “nice” on the skin. I have combo/oily skin and didn’t feel Iike it helped. The perfume smell is strong and it looked cakey on my skin.",1
"I received this product as a free sample and have been so pleased with it ever since. Love this product. It really does do what it says it will do. My pores are smaller after using it for a week. It leaves my skin clean but not dry, which has been challenging with other cleansers. I follow it with the toner and moisturizer to complete my routine and overall my skin has improved. I’ve been using it for over 2 weeks now, and I’ve been very pleased as my skin has not reacted negatively to it. I love that it uses Neem seed oil, as not many products on the market use it and it’s supposedly a wonderful product. Would definitely recommend and would buy in the future!",2
"After reading the mixed reviews, I was at first nervous to purchase this. However, after trying this product, I have nothing bad to say about it! This product has completely changed my dry, dehydrated, flaky skin!! I cannot recommend this mask enough! It is completely worth the hyper and I will forever be repurchasing it!",2
"I received this product for free to test and review. I wear sunscreen everyday, and this is a very convenient option for under makeup. It’s compact size also makes it easy to carry on the go. The price point is high so I likely won’t repurchase, but if you aren’t bothered by that it is worth checking out.",1
"I struggled with hormonal acne, but once I was gifted this I gave it a try and it stopped my acne instantly! After 2.5 years of ongoing breakouts my skin is finally happy and feels plump and healthy as ever! Definitely my holy grail!!",2
Non irritating and does it’s job well! And I don’t mind the smell because I love oats For a cleansing balm the texture is quite thick and that may not be for everyone and a cleanser should be used after bc this will not be enough ton it’s own to remove,1
This is the best!!! The most hydrating yet soothing I’ve ever used !!! I like to use it in combination with their glycolic serum and Sunday Riley’s good genes it’s a match made in heaven!,2
I received this eye cream from Influenster.  I’ve been using it ever since I got back from vacation with a slight sun burn and tan.  This worked beautifully.  I’m 28 and have been looking for a good eye cream that works well with makeup and this did just that.  Makeup applied really nicely after.  I do feel like my under-eyes looked and felt very youthful after.,2
"Love this face wash! Tried it first, and then a First Aide Beauty face wash, which was also good, but I prefer this Origins one. Really does what it says for combo skin, helps keep some of the shine in check, but nourishes the dry spots. And it just makes my skin so soft and fresh!",2
"Anyone who has the pleasure of interacting of me knows I be struggling with my lips. Was happy to try yet another lip mask. I like that this one is more occlusive than other high end lip masks- this really feels like a good ointment for struggly lips. Also no discernible fragrance/flavor, which I appreciate cuz I usually can’t stand most flavors in lip products. This also comes in an adorable tiny jar for those who loves tiny things.",1
"When I first purchased this product I would have given it a higher review than now. Honestly, it is very good, but not worth 80.00. Many less expensive glycolic exfoliaters can give comparable results. It doesn’t last very long, and the packaging is deceiving. I don’t like it when I can’t tell when my product is almost out. It is a good mask, just not worth the price in my estimation.",1
The title says it all! The best I’ve ever used,2
I love the bottle design as it makes the application easy and mess free. The consistency and the texture of the mask is also great and allows for it to easily spread on the skin. It made my skin tingle a bit but made it feel nice and cool once I washed it off. It made my skin feel really smooth and soft and helped removed any dead skin that was previously visible.,1
"love the glass and refillable packaging and the texture if the cream is so soothing to my skin, my skin was so soft and plump after , keeps moisturized for long time, I love using both in my morning skincare routine and night time too, best during fall season and winters .",2
"I immediately noticed a difference in the tone and texture of my skin after using this product! It felt so soft, full and plump. Thank you tatcha! I received this product complimentary for review purposes but I will definitely buy!",2
"I LOVE LOVE this product. My skin is oily and definitely acne prone. Before purchasing the full size facial cleanser I tried out the trial kid and was hooked. In after a short week with the kit, I could visibly see change, I PROMISE. Just stick to all the steps at night and in the morning and there is no way you cant see change! It is VERY costy when buying the full size products, but great skin isnt free. Worth the hype for sure!!",2
"I love the rejuvenation of a daily peel. I opted to use on a weekend and I felt the peel definitely made my skin feel smoother. However, I would not invest the money into Dr. Dennis Gross’ skincare line. I am grateful to try the product but found other similar products within my price point.",1
"This is one of the best products I’ve ever bought. It’s lightweight, smells great, and does the job without any fuss or muss. I was on the hunt for something simple to cancel out my redness without covering my skin and looking cakey. This does the job BEAUTIFULLY. My skin still looks like skin, you can still see the natural texture and slight flaws, but my redness has drastically reduced. The SPF is a huge plus too! The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I noticed it left a white-ish cast similar to sunscreen, but that fades after 10-15 minutes. I’ve read reviews saying that this doesn’t sit well under make up but I can’t relate because I honestly don’t even bother with additional coverage after applying this! I’m more oily than dry, but I still make sure to use a moisturizer before using this. I apply it with my fingers and pat it on my face gently. I noticed it will start to pill or settle into any dry patches if 1. I don’t moisturize enough, 2. it’s been too long since I last exfoliated, and/or 3. I rub it in roughly and am not gentle enough. All in all, this is an absolute dream product for someone who just wants a simple, natural redness-free look PLUS SPF. So glad I bought this before it sold out! Thank you Dr. Jart+!!!!",1
"Overall, this is an excellent product. The scent is light, and I don’t feel like I’m wearing anything on my face after application. With regard to daily use, I wouldn’t use this alone, since it doesn’t stop my skin from getting shiny, which can happen quickly. It works well for days when I’m not wearing too much makeup and want a bit of moisture. I think the issue is more related to how my skin behaves (combination) more so than an issue with this product. It’s also worth knowing that the design of the plastic cap dispenses lots of product quickly - so that can be difficult to control. I prefer to add product slowly, so I definitely have to be careful when using this product so I don’t end up with too much on my skin/waste the product unnecessarily.",1
"This cream feels great on my normal- dry skin without feeling heavy. It absorbs well and doesn’t burn or break me out, which is the true test for me as many creams do. It also doesn’t have a strong scent which I like.",2
"It’s really good and hydrated, I’ve been using for 3 days and my skin is soooo soft!",2
"I use this balm mostly under all my glosses or alone and it does its job so well. It absorbs right up and leaves my lips feeling super soft and moisturized. However, like with most pots of lip gloss, I would suggest using a lip gloss applicator for sanitary reasons.",2
"I really wanted to like this, looking for a cleaner eye makeup remover. I use MAC haute and Naughty, and can never seem to get it off. I was using sense eyes by MUFE, but they test on animals. Green Clean did remove my mascara, which is impressive, but after using it my vision was super blurry, no matter how many times I rinsed. So it definitely works, but I wouldn’t use it on eye makeup.",1
Like the product. It glides very well over the skin and spreads easily. Love the stick form so it’s easy to use as well.,1
I’ve used this toner twice and I have absolutely no acne but somehow I got two whiteheads under my lip after using this. Also the toner foams which is weird to me. I’ve never had a toner that foams as I apply it to my face with a cotton ball. I find drug store toners to be better than big brands ie. biore & pixi’s glow tonic are better and both my go too’s. Also the price is better.,0
"I really wanted to like this product because I have used other Origins products and I had heard great things about this one.It absorbs quickly into the skin, it is lightweight and doesn’t feel like a heavy cream, it feels nice on the skin, and it smells great like oranges.Unfortunately, after one use, my skin got all red and blotchy, and I even tried it off and on over the course of a week and it made my skin feel tingly and burning and then I continued to break out really bad.I’m giving it 2 stars because it is definitely NOT good for people who have sensitive skin, but I think that it would be a great product for people who have regular skin.",0
"Most important step to my regimen!! Has significantly smoothed out my uneven texture within two weeks! This is a holy grail!! Blows my usual purchase of Sunday Riley , out of the water and saves me money!!! Amazing product line .",2
"I really wanted to love this product like I usually do when it comes to Glow Recipe products, but this product was incredibly underwhelming. It leaves an oily residue and pills when used with make up. The smell is nice, but for the price, I am not a fan and would most likely not purchase this.",1
"I had a serious breakout on my face. My lips and corners of my mouth were got really dark and dry. My dermatologist told me about the salve. After a few days, the dryness was gone. A week later, the color was restored to my lips & corners of my mouth. This will forever be a favorite of mine.",2
Love the rice wash for my sensitive mature skin. Makes it so soft and hydrated.,1
"I’ve been using this for about two weeks now, and I honestly love it. I feel like I am more matte-looking than usual, and introducing this new product to my morning routine hasn’t made me break out!",2
Better than Clinique. Better than any other brands cleansing oil. 10/10 would recommend.,2
"Have tried my fair share of moisturizers, as someone w dry skin who when dry turns really oily. I have to say I may have found my daytime soulmate. She’s light, but I pair her with hyaluronic acid and *chefs kiss* so good. I am acne prone and I have had great results. Doesn’t clear my skin but doesn’t contest my pores, and keeps me nice and hydrated during the day.",2
"Writing this review for every super pale person who is considering tanning products who have never, ever tanned in their life and have absolutely no experience. GET THIS STUFF. I got the light shade because I’ve never used a tanning product before but this stuff is absolutely idiot proof. You can’t mess it up! Mix a few drops in with your favorite moisturizer and really rub it in. Make sure it’s evenly spread as much as you can and you’re good. It helps to exfoliate in the shower before you use it, but you don’t need to make a whole ordeal out of it. It’s even, natural looking (not orange at all) and you’ll develop a noticeable tan in just a couple days of use. I got so many compliments from people who only know me as my ghostly pale self saying that I looked like I got some sun, they didn’t even know it was fake until I told them! I know I needed a review like this when I was looking for a tanning product so as a fellow white as snow person who can’t tan to save her life, I fully recommend this product. Fool proof and easy! I might even switch to the darker shade later on to see what that might look like. It’s so nice feeling tan for the first time in my life and I owe it all to these drops! I use about 4-6 drops on my legs, 4 on my arms and 1-2 on my face. It’s flawless. Worth every penny!",2
"I have to avoid anything with benzoyl peroxide in it.  So when I started breaking out on my forehead I had to find something fast.  I just bought this on a whim, knowing that their products are not tested on animals and are of high quality.  My main issue is my oily nose prone to blackheads & white heads and big pores cause of it.  I applied this miracle product and woke up to tiny pores and a new nose.  I wish I found this sooner!!  It is that effective!!!  I have sensitive skin to boot, so I was prepared for a reaction but my skin took it well.  It does dry some areas of your skin, but it works.  Just use a heavier moisturizer for the dry patches. And I shook the bottle before realizing you DON’T SHAKE it.  Another thing I had to search for was directions. Best used before bedtime and take off all silver rings(it turns it black) .  I am soooo happy to find such an effective product.  I recommend it highly.",2
"This is my 3rd bottle of this cleanser!! It’s so gentle on the skin and it’s never irritated my skin. I use this 2x a day, a dime sized amount, and a bottle can last me around 6 months. I love how simple the ingredients are and especially that it’s fragrance free. I tried the cleanser bars first, and loved both, but I find the jelly cleanser just easier and more convenient to use! Will be buying over and over again!!",2
"Ever since I started using this product, my skin has cleared so much. I don’t have as many whiteheads/blackheads and it helped calm down my acne. My skin is also so smooth.",2
best sunscreen I have ever used. I love the smell as it reminds of the beach. It absorbs very easily and do not make you look white. It is so easy to use it for everyday and I became a SPF believer after thus. I wish it was a bit lower cost but It is what it is.,2
"THIS IS MY HOLY GRAIL. So i have combination mildly sensitive skin, and this worked wonders for me. Visible change in my overall complexion along with getting rid of those nasty little spots. My skin did purge a little with the first week but I have no used it only a few times and my skin looks amazing. I will say the mask does stink, it stunk my whole room up lol. But trust me when I say the stink doesn’t matter when your skin looks like this. Mask before shower! like someone else said it helps with getting the smell off!",2
"I’m not really sure if this is making any difference in my skin, it honestly looks the same since I’ve been using it. Feels like I’m just putting water on my face before a moisturizer, not worth the price in my opinion.",1
BEST FOR PIMPLE HIDING! Love this when you have pimples forming. Put on a white head and boom in 5 hrs its sucks it all out! And the dark mark only last 1-2 days. Recommend anyday. Barley noticeable !!,2
"The product itself is smaller than I thought it would be but that’s not as much of an issue because it fits into bathroom counter space better. I was just surprised.There are so many cleansing balms, oils, milks, etc these days because of the double cleanse trend AND most of them work pretty well! So brands have to do something different in order for theirs to stand out. I love that this one has additionally nourishing and beneficial elements such as: vitamin B, vitamin E, vitamin C. BUT MOST OF ALL: the thing I look for the most these days is if it also comes with some sort of exfoliation. THIS HAS BECOME A NON NEGOTIABLE DEAL BREAKER FOR ME because I used to use cleansing balms and precleaners that were great at eliminating the surface layer of makeup and build up from the day but my skin would eventually break out after prolonged usage because they are all made of oils at the end of the day and we have dead skin cells every week/month. This is why exfoliating properties are so important to me. Yes, most products will get rid of the first layer of makeup, oil, sebum, sweat, etc but how can products also deep clean your pores if it doesn’t also take care of dead skin cells. Yes, I know I can exfoliate separately but why should I in a world of SO MANY BEAUTY PRODUCTS?I love it when a brand is effective, efficient, and knows what they’re doing enough to make a competitively great product that does more than 1 thing. Gifted by dermalogica",1
"I got a sample and after just using it for a few days in clogged all the pores under my eyes. It doesn’t really blend into the skin as you would an eye cream would, especially for that steep price point. This is definitely one you would NEED to try out a sample first.",0
"Do I think this scrubs and your left with balls of dead skin on your face?  No. However, I do think it exfoliates. I love love love the way my skin feels after I use it. It feels so soft and plump!  I had to go buy the jumbo bottle. Love this stuff!",2
"This is definitely an effective sunscreen as I was outside all day without reapplying and didn’t get burnt. It went on smoothly and blended nicely. However, it does smell like cheap sunscreen and this is NOT reef safe as it has chemical sunscreen ingredients. Really wish this was just a  mineral sunscreen as it would be perfect.",1
"I started off with a mini size at first, and loved it so much I converted to full size.  I e had acne sunce I was 12.  I still tend to have oily skin even at 49.  This cleans away the grime and grit and leaves my face feeling very refreshed.  I went for a month or two without, and I could rrally tell the difference.  I love this sugary scrub. So refreshing. Like I said, I’m  hooked!!",2
My ABSOLUTE favorite moisturizer! I have oily-combination skin (w/ extremely oily T zone). This cream feels amazing going into my skin. It completely hydrates my skin without being soaked up too fast! It doesn’t cause my skin to get more oily either.,2
Great product. Easily to apply and get your daily dose of retinol. Love the container and packaging. Would highly recommend to help bring life back to your eyes.,2
"Love it. So smooth, WORKS and is easy to wash off! It never irritates my skin, is more environmentally friendly than constantly using a make up wipe and it has a great price. Love this company but especially this product. I swear by it and recommend it to all my friends.",2
"I received this as a sample, after purchasing the Babyfacial (which is AMAZING!!!). I wanted to try a few other DE products, since I love the Babyfacial and Retro cream. I’m stuck. I’m out of the trial, and now simply HAVE to buy the whole bottle. I’ll be asking for gift certs to Sephora for every birthday and Christmas to support my new DE habit!!!",2
This is an absolute staple in my skincare routine! I have been using this moisturizer for 10 plus years. It’s amazing for my super sensitive skin. I’ll probably never switch!,2
Love it you wake up and your skin is so amazing bright and soft,2
I have been using this for 5 years and is my tried and true tanning drops. If you have light-medium skin the medium drops are good for you.,2
"Magic!!! Love this stuff! What did I use before I found it?? Makes my skin look naturally beautiful and not make-uppy, even in direct sunlight",2
"I would be completely lost without this face wash.Not only does it foam so beautiful you only have to use the littlest amount (get your money’s worth!), but it smells incredible!I have extremely sensitive/dry skin that is prone to breakouts and I rarely get zits anymore since using this.I’ve been using it for about a year now, and would never switch to anything else.Thank you Origins!",2
"I’ve been using Tatcha skincare for about 2 years now.I recently ran out of the Tatcha luminous deep hydration firming serum and decided to purchase this one.I didn’t go off of the 800 + free sample reviews, I love this brand and had high hopes.It’s not groundbreaking, it felt like I was putting drugstore lotion on my face.Waiting for my Tatcha luminous deep hydration firming serum to arrive in the mail as this product is being returned.",0
"I was excited to get this sample, but not enamored with the results. For the record - I have sensitive, dry skin and I use lots of chapsticks and glosses - my lips are always covered. When I used this at night, I woke up with bone-dry lips. I use waxy chapsticks, so this was uncomfortable for me. I could see using this as a lip treatment - it has lots of nice ingredients in it, but I would have to seal it in with something else on top.",1
"Love this, used daily works great!",2
I really like this eye cream. I notice such a difference with the line less noticeable and it gives a slight glow. BUT you have to be careful. In my experience I was using it every night and after the second day my got burning sensation on the out corner of the eye. So I cut it down to 2-3x a week and no more burning sensation. And a little goes a long way. You do not need a a lot just a dot. The price of it though is really not worth it but at the same time I have had it for a month and since I only use at night 2/3x a week I still have a good amount left so if it can last me 2-3 months then the price isn’t that bad. I do have sensitive eyes so that’s why I think too much of the. Retinol might of been too much for me but once I got down no more burning!,1
This product is great for puffy eyes. My only issue was that it seemed hard to absorb and was a bit greasy.,1
"I absolutely love this toner, I have been using this for quite sometime now and I can definitely see my pores minimized. I love the smell of this toner and my skin feel so soft and radiant. My have sensitive skin and this toner has made such a difference.",2
"I got this in one of the #voxbox and love it! Would definitely recommend for the hyaluronic acid ! Plus it has antioxidants to help against environmental damage to your skin! And it’s a nice semi-clean product being paraben, sulfate, and mineral oil Free! Over great for your skin and leaves you feeling super soft!",1
"Love this set, its a re-purchase and I’m getting one for my sister during the sale! Within a few nights of use, there is a  drastic improvement to baby-like, soft, smooth and hydrated skin! Wish the set was more affordable!",2
"I bought the small one to test it out, It works wonders for my combination skin. I have now bought the biggest I could get before I run out of my old one because I can’t take a shower without applying this now. Highly recommend.",2
"I got this product because a sale person at sephora highly recommended it. I liked that it had fruit enzymes and lactic acid, so I got it. While I agree that it is a mild peel (what I was looking for) and leaves skin soft and moisturized, I found that the circular rubbing that this product requires in order to peel the skin probably clogged some pores along the way. Besides some of the rubbed off sticky debris (ew sorry) got stuck on the very thin peach fuzz I have on the sides of my face. I went back to my glycolic peel, which has a water like consistency and doesn’t require any rubbing. It got rid of the clogged pores again.",0
I’ve been using this for two weeks at night to take off my makeup; I’m super tired at the end of the night and I need a one step cleaner/makeup remover. My break outs have reduced. It never leaves my skin oily. It’s also the only one step cleaner and makeup remover I’ve used that actually removes all makeup. I always tone afterwards and there used to be left over makeup with my other cleaners but there is never a trace of makeup left behind on the cotton pads now.,2
"I’ve been using this product daily for about a month now. I use it every morning except I have skipped a few days here and there. I can honestly say that I’ve seen NO visible difference in my skin tone or my skin texture. However, I will say that I have noticed a difference in the way my skincare goes on my face. I feel like it goes on smoother and that it’s absorbed better. But I am disappointed with not seeing anything visible differences in my skin....",1
I originally really liked this moisturizer coz it didn’t make my skin look oily but then it broke me out and gave me milia so I’m going to be returning it.,0
This product is unlike any other. It’s pricy but well worth it. One large bottle will last you 6-8 months even if using 2x a day. I started using it last year and I’ve seen a significant difference in my skin. People have said I’ve aged backwards. It does take a few months to notice the changes. I use it right after toner before moisturizer and it works perfectly. Highly recommend!,2
"I love taking care of my skin and constantly hunting for new products to make my routine more efficient. This serum definitely feels great on my skin, can’t wait for amazing results.",2
I could stand most smells from products and it actually bothers me when people complain about the smell of a product but the smell of this product is awful. To me smells rancid. I tried leaving it on and thinking it would go away but didn’t. I rinsed my face and the smell was still there had to rewash my face. I wish I could of left it on and given a rave review but I couldn’t get past the smell. I am even thinking that maybe the product I tried went bad because I can’t imagine Sunday Riley making a product that smells so horrendous.,0
Nice cream but nothing dramatic,1
I recieved this for a review and I fell inlove. Need to try,2
"I have sensitive skin and tend to break out and have a hard time finding stuff that works for me. I decided to try this after using the DDF moisturizer forever. The first couple days I used the Caudalie Sorbet on half my face and my normal moisturizer on the other half. First day I noticed the Caudalie side was less shiny later in the day. After I went full face I noticed my dry spots the DDF couldn’t take care of went away after a few days. And the biggest bonus of all, which I noticed in other peoples reviews is my skin cleared up...NO PIMPLES! The scent is nice but scared me at first having sensitive but it has not been a problem. You get more with the DDF package but I find I was needing to use less of the Caudalie which goes a long way. Highly recommend!",2
"I love this peel! I have cystic acne and my skin was very congested before I started using this. I had alot of small bumps and acne on my cheeks and jawline, I only get cystic acne on my neck and chin. My skin has cleared sooo much, I use this peel 2 times a week. It clears out my nose pores and I will continue to use as long as its around. I really wish I had pictures to show yall, but I’m very insecure about my skin.",2
Received this product for free as a part of the Influenster program. I like the smell of the moisturizer in the morning and haven’t noticed any skin irritation as I often feel with rose or seed-based moisturizers now on the market.  The downside is it takes a but longer to dry and if you use a powder foundation it can create streaks.,1
"Triple the action with this power-packed eye renewal eye balm. The balm is creamy and fastly effective, after one use my eye lines and dark circles were less visible. I  used this on my eyes every morning and night for one month, and the results were incredible! If your eyes are in need of some TLC, then this is the perfect eye balm for you.",2
I am loving the Squalane Omega repair Creme. It feels so luxurious going on and my skin feels soft and supple! Bonus it doesnt make my skin feel slimey or oily and boosts my skins hydration! Looking forward to seeing if it gives me lasting ageless results.,1
"This cream is pretty good. It’s very rich and moisturizing. It’s a cream, as opposed to a gel-based formula like the original. I prefer to use this at night, as it takes a while to soak in. It’s great for my sensitive eyes.",1
Love the way my skin looks and feels the morning after applying this. I personally think this may have helped to get rid if a few small millia under my eyes.,2
I really love the texture of the moisturizer. It feels velvety soft & nourishing . I waited a few days to be sure it did not create any sort of allergic reaction & it is safe to say perfect for sensitive dry combo skin . I definitely would rebuy,2
Great for oily or combination skin. My face felt softer after just a couple of uses. Use it combined with the C-firma from the same brand as it helps to hydrate without leaving any oily residue.,2
"I love this Origins High Potency Night-A-Mins renewal cream! I first used this as part of a try-it kit and got hooked! It was a wonderful somewhat citrus-y smell that’s not too strong yet still noticeable enough.I wear this over night and in the morning my skin looks and feels great! I have normal-combination skin with the occasional breakouts and I really feel like this cream treats my skin well. It moisturizes without being too oily or heavy and doesn’t make me break out. It’s not exactly the cheapest night cream out there, but when compared to other products the price is actually fairly reasonable.I would definitely recommend this product if you’re looking for something to refresh your skin!",2
"Better off using aquaphor. This product makes your lips feel hydrated when wearing it, but actually dried out my lips BIG TIME over time. I used to love laneige lip products until I realized they are whats CAUSING my dry/cracked lips. ugh.",0
"Things I like: unscentedgentle and probably good for sensitive skinfeels hydratinggood for night time as a before bed cream Thing I don’t like: would be horrible under makeup especially if you need an additional SPFlots of shinegreasy and sits on my skintakes a LONG time to soak inFor the price, there are better moisturizers that do what this does out there that I like better and feel are more effective. others love this one, it’s just not the one for me",1
"Some context - I have had dry, peeling and sometimes cracked lips for the last year and nothing worked until this. Love this product! I have been using it for a few weeks now and have not had dry lips since the first time I tried it.Love the smell, the texture, how it feels on my lips. I won’t go without it now! I am interested to see how it holds up when next winter comes around.",2
This is the one skincare product I can’t go without! I have dry sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate my skin and makes it feel so hydrated and plump. I tried to stop using this product because it’s so expensive but immediately I felt a difference in my skin! I’ve tried to find replacements for it as well and nothing comes close. I have repurchased 3 times already. I know it’s expensive but one bottle last me about 12 months and I use it twice a day! Will keep repurchasing this no matter what!,2
This worked wonders on my hormonal acne. Skin started breaking out like crazy after my miscarriages around the time of the month. This product reduces the cystic pimples along my jaw line overnight and eliminates them in a few days. It doesn’t however get things like blackheads. It is a bit drying after a few days for me. Also it stings like crazy at first and smells funny but both go away quickly! I don’t know how I survived without it before!,2
I understand the hype now! I use my hands to apply it and I pat it into my skin. It leaves a sticky texture which helps to lock in all the serums and moisturizer I use after. I’ve noticed it helps keep my skin more hydrated and my skin is glowing after. It also smells like jolly ranchers! What’s not to love!,2
"The versatility of this product is great. I’ve used it as suggested, as a moisturizer, on nail cuticles, rough patches on your skin, and a hair serum. All have great results... it leaves your skin soft. A little goes a very long way. Although the smell is neutral and it tames/controls your frizz(I found it worked better on wet hair) and makes your hair soft, it doesn’t smell good on hair. Almost like a “cooking oil“ smell. So you are better off buying a separate serum just for hair since they will put a mild fragrance in it to smell nice.",1
I received this sunscreen from Influenster in response for my honest opinion and I have to say that it is a beautiful product! I use it as my facial sunscreen. It has the texture of a lotion and absorbs really well without leaving a white cast. My skin feels really soft and moisturized afterwards and even has a nice glow. My makeup applies beautifully over top of this. Added bonus would be the soft fresh scent it has! Definitely would recommend!,2
So gentle. Lime sorbet scent and melts into a heavenly texture,2
"Let me just say I love this stuff. I now buy the large pump bottle.  Comes out easier and more controlled and it’s plastic in case of accidental dropping.   I use this in the morning and at night after I wash my face.  Don’t bother wasting it on a cotton pad.  I use 1-2 squirts directly in my hand and rub it all over my face, neck, and decollete, pressing it into my skin all over after my hand is empty.  Then I let it dry for about 10 minutes before applying my moisturizer.  My skin has become clearer and I have less acne issues.  There’s a slight smell that increases as it is exposed to more air.  Wow, what a difference this has made.  If I run out I can definitely see the difference in my skin in the time it takes me to get a new bottle but then back it goes once I start using again.  It’s expensive but totally worth it to me.  I didn’t care for some of their other products like the moisturizers but this is the bomb.  I currently use a moisturizer Omorovicza and they have a mist that might be similar so I may try it out but it will have to be out of this world to get me to switch out my SKII Essence.",2
I saw this in a Jeffree star video and I have not gone off using it since! Such a gentle way to melt your makeup off and it lasts decently long for the price point. Wouldn’t switch to any other cleansing balm!!,2
"Rlly bad, it didn’t absorb well and just sat wet on the skin, as the day progressed my skin felt dry and oily in the t zone as if I haven’t moisturized at all. Later found out it has Dimethicone was inside it which tracks bacteria into the skin, not sure why this is clean at Sephora when it’s in fact not and even harmful.",0
This product did not irritate my skin at all yet I could see results after the first treatment.,2
I received a small mini sample of this product from #trywithtopboxcircle for my honest review on this product. I  was impressed by the lack of fragrance and how light this serum is. I put it on before bed and it absorbed into my skin right away I do also love the fact that there is retinol in this product as well. I was only able to use this product once so I didn’t really see any results but I do like the texture of this product and that it is light weight and scent free.,1
"I have combination skin and frequently have red, inflamed cheeks. This face wash is amazing for removing oil without over dying skin. I’ve also noticed a significant decrease in redness. It’s definitely pricier than I’m used to paying for a face wash, but a little does go a long way!",2
"I was very skeptical of this at first. When I put it on my fingers it felt like it was going to be very heavy and greasy feeling on my face. When I actually applied it, it felt so nice on my face and my face felt soooooooo soft. It didnt feel heavy or greasy.",2
I love mixing this with my sunscreen or with drunk elephant D-Bronzi in the summer for a quick makeup application in lieu of foundation. in the fall/winter/spring it’s always the first step after serums for my a.m skincare routine. I’m obsessed with dewy skin and this product gives you a natural glow/ it;s not hydrating enough to be worn alone for me in the winter but in the summer it’s great.,1
"A creamy but yet not greasy moisturizer. No scent and absorbed in nicely. I think this would be an excellent fall/winter moisturizer for when I’m a little drier. Overall, I liked it!",1
"I am blown away with this sleeping mask! I have used a handful of sleeping masks, but this is by far the best. During this time of the year i have very dry skin due to the weather changes. This mask has helped rehydrate and rejuvenate my skin to feel smooth and supple. At first, the product can feel a bit oily in the skin, then tacky once it starts drying -- but this combo just means you’ll wake up to great skin! My skin has defintely change (slowly but surely) since I’ve been using this mask. Although i was given this mask to try out for an honest review, I highly recommend it and will be purchasing this mask here on out!",2
"I am currently using the dewy skin serum, which I really like, so I decided to try this mini that was included in my Sephora birthday gift. I have mixed feelings. It is very rich as it claims to be, however, it glides over my skin and I don’t feel as though it absorbs very well. I have only used it at night. The second morning I woke up with a big red blemish on my face. It may or may not be due to this product… so I may try this again and see if another blemish pops up. I am not one to waste products so I will use it as a luxurious hand and cuticle cream if I decide it is not the right product for my face.",1
"This serum is wonderful if you have dry skin. It is nice that you can mix it with the vitam c serum from Drunk Elephant. I have oily skin so I don’t need to use this very often, but I do use it on my hands with my hand cream regularly. The packaging is really nice, you only need 1 pump. I would recommend this product if you need a serum that helps with dryness.",2
"Wow. Wow. Wow. There’s so much to like about this serum -- everything but the price!I have sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin. I am 39yo. I use Rx acne medications (tretinoin at 0.05% and Acanya, which is benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin lotion). Using these Rx products make already-sensitive skin extra-cranky.Based on the good reviews and with the recent % off promotion, I figured I’d give it a try. I’ve used it two weeks now. In this short period of time, dark marks have faded entirely (post-acne hyperpigmentation), my skin has smoothed out so much that I stopped using my primer, and my skin feels like buttah.I didn’t experience any sensitivity issues at all with this product and used it nightly from day one.It has a thick gel texture. At first, I was using two pumps, but I think one pump is fine to cover the face. If you want it for use on neck/décolletage, then you might need a pump and a half.Again, I have sensitive skin. Like, really obnoxiously cranky skin that gets red and blotchy when I introduce new products at all. I was totally shocked that I experienced no sensitivy or irritation or redness or flaking -- nothing! -- when using this product.It is so hard to find a product that exfoliates and hydrates at the same time. This product manages to do both.I wish I could tell how much is in the bottle, but it is opaque (likely to keep the product from reacting) and you can’t tell.The price is bananas, but it is hard to argue with the results.If you’re in your 20s and have no skin issues, save your money. If you have uneven skin,or if you have acne, or if you have fine lines or wrinkles, give this a chance.",2
"This primer left my skin feeling so hydrated and glowy. I haven’t noticed much change in my dark spots but I don’t think I’ve been using it long enough to get the full benefits. It is very light, like a serum, and not greasy. It blurs my pores nicely and makes my skin look pretty, which is nice because who wants a full face of makeup on under a mask? I use this alone or under foundation. My only complaint is that it’s pretty heavily fragranced. -1 star for that.",1
"It was a nice cream and I liked the consistency but it didn’t really live up to the hype. Not at all bad, but just nothing special. Wasn’t really worth the money and wouldn’t buy it again.",1
"I LOVE this moisturizer. It does actually feel like you’re covering your face with water and it stays all day. My skin type is sensitive, has redness whenever I use any kind of product on it, and combination. With this moisturizer I found that it didn’t go immediately red when I applied it (which is rare for me) and it didn’t leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. The hydration stays all day while feeling light on the skin. I highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive combination skin with redness! Thank you Tatcha!",2
love it. been using it for years!,2
"this is a favorite cleanser. not enough on its own to wash away my makeup but as the second step in a double cleanse or for morning cleanse, it’s so gentle and smells amazing. will keep repurchasing.",2
I received this product for free but was excited to try it as I have a few dark spots and freckles. When I first starting using it I really liked it and noticed my skin brightening and dark spots fading after only a week.  But after that I did start to experience a very strong stinging sensation and my skin was getting dry flaky spots in certain areas.  I reduced the usage to every other day but still the same dryness and stinging. I’m going to try and incorporate it every 3 days or maybe only once a week.,1
Helps for redness so good! Even can skip foundation.,2
"Love these wipes. Smell good, cheap, and get the job done. Non-irritating also.",2
"Amazing cleanser. It removes EVERYTHING with one wash. It doesn’t dry my face put (which is a problem I run into with most other cleansers). I am a huge advocate for trying new products and buying trial size (I rarely stick with one brand), but after my trial size starting running low, I immediately placed an order. I can’t imagine using anything else! Nothing compares!",2
I actually been using this product for years now even though Influenster sent it to me I’m very familiar with this brand and its products I had their face cream I cream name it I have it even though it’s pricey it’s worth it because it does the job as much as I love Sephora sometimes you can find this brand at Marshall’s or TJ Maxx for a little bit cheaper,2
"I was given a sample of this by a Tarte rep yesterday. She put some on my face and it felt amazing! I used it again last night and this morning and I love it. It’s light and dewy, not greasy and heavy. I usually use Lancome Nutrix Royal, which I also love on my older skin, but I think I’m a convert. Not to mention that the price is about $30 less. I think I’ll be switching!",2
This stuff is amazing. My skin has so much texture. I have gone through a million exfoliating cleansers and peels and nothing makes me skin feel as smooth as this. It has definitely helped with my sebaceous filaments also. They aren’t gone but they are less noticeable.,2
"I received a sample of this product, tried it out and was completely obsessed at how hydrated and super smooth it left my skin after! This is very similar to the tarte hydrating cream but I like this one more. Definitely recommend.",2
"Love this product. It leaves your skin feeling clean, fresh and tingling with out feeling dried out.",2
Best product I have ever purchased. It removes all the imperfections from my skin and gives a nice glow. My black spots have almost all disappeared. It also removes few wrinkles!!! I hope they will never discontinue it! I highly recommend it to everybody. I have one to my Mum and she loves it too.,2
"One of the better foundations I’ve tried! I love that it has such high spf but doesn’t feel too heavy. I would agree it’s not as full coverage as other foundations, but I prefer that.",2
"This is actually a very impressive product that seems to work wonderfully! I received this complimentary to sample, and I am so glad I did for sure!",2
"I tried this product after the girl in the skin department had recommended this for me! I thought no Clinique is old out dated and for old people! But I gave it a try And I was very surprised it did well for the price paid! I would say it is very very decent for a mediocre med end line product!! I’m now on my second or third bottle, I switch it up with skin products depending on weather time of month and for just a regular product if u have no skin problems and r kinda on the dry side sometimes then this is perfect!!! Very pleased!!",2
"I honestly really enjoy Glow Recipe products and was really excited when the Plum line was getting another addition. I have really dry skin so as much as I love the watermelon one, I wanted something with extra oomph! This product really hydrated my skin. The texture is whipped and creamy and feels really silky-like. I like using this both day and night and it definitely gives off a healthy glow. It sinks into the skin and my skin and face just look a lot healthier. I’m honestly loving this a lot:)",2
Works wonders and doesnt leave your face feeling oily,2
These actually work! First day I had one of those under the skin zits. The ones you can’t pop but it’s hurt so bad when you push on it. I put one of the dots on that night and by the next morning it was still there just not as bad. I put another dot on it that night and literally by the next morning I could see the white stuff that had collected on the dot itself and my zit was gone! It doesn’t even hurt. It would have taken me days just to get rid of it if I just let it be.,2
"I’d skip this product.  Purchased it in hopes of increasing/maintaining a bit of youthful pep and elasticity to my orbital area and found that this cream did not deliver.It didn’t do any harm--which is good-- but it didn’t do any good either.  It moisturizes alright, I guess, but the formula is extremely thick and greasy, which might be a plus if you like that kind of thing.  To be honest, I didn’t feel like there was any skin-science magic happening after I slathered it on.  (And we all know what that good skin-science magic looks and feels like.)In short, this product was an expensive let down that performed like a high-end whipped Vaseline.",0
I have been using this for a month along with the cleanser. I love this moisturizer! It has been a wonderful part of balancing my skin. It absorbs totally into my skin and calms it down. My skin texture has greatly improved. Still love this!,2
"I have dry skin and while this does not do anything for me as a final moisturizer, it’s the perfect hydration step to layer under moisturizer and thick SPF.",1
I really really wanted to love this after I saw one of my favorite youtubers use this but it made me break out so bad! Even after the first use my skin felt super sticky and I woke up with red patches and a TON of new breakouts. If you have sensitive skin I would reach for something else.,0
I would recommend this moisturizer to everyone. It goes on weightlessly  and feels my skin feels so soft and pampered.,2
"Ester lauder never disappoints with their products and this eye cream is no exception! It’s perfectly thick, smooth, and creamy. I love the way it goes on and that I instantly feel like my eyes are more hydrated. It’s good at plumping the skin and making you look refreshed. It’s a great addition to your skincare routine.",2
"I love the tint on this balm, it’s a soft pretty pink that looks very natural. It glides on smoothly, leaving your lips with an almost cushiony feel to them. I do find, however, that after a while of wear, the moisture seems to fade and the pigment that remains gets a little dry. Full disclosure, I have been using this on very dry lips as a result of an allergy to another lip product. On my regular lips I doubt it would be an issue but if you suffer from severley dry lips, I say stick to the clear one.",1
"Feels great when you put it on, visibly smooths skin on contact and works great with just a bit of pressed powder on top if you want a no-makeup look.  Use caution if you have oily skin because it definitely luminizes, though could probably be used in selective areas if you’re looking for a very subtle highlight.  Wish that it had SPF so I could wear just this instead of layering sunscreen underneath.",2
"Great alternative to makeup wipes and gentler on the skin.  However, I do feel like it makes eyesight a bit hazy after initial wash.  Not greasy but there’s definitely a film left behind.  Absolutely must wash with a cleanser afterwards",1
"Unfortunately I did not notice any difference. I’ve used this several times but my skin looks the same. It perhaps feels a bit more hydrated, but I can achieve a similar feel with products that cost less. I did not experience any sort of negative reaction (e.g., breaking out), which is why I provided it with two stars instead of one. I have combo skin (more dry during the winter months).",0
"A basic cleanser with an amazing green scent. My skin feels nice and clean after using. I have combination, acne prone skin and often have struggles in finding a good cleanser. This product does not make my skin feel overly dry after using as many cleansers do. I received this item as a sample in my Play box a couple months ago and finally got around to trying it out. Love the glass bottle packaging. I would recommend this product to others and plan to buy the full size item.",2
"This cleansing balm works very well for removing make-up and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I have sensitive, redness prone skin and this has never given me a reaction.  I wish they would come out with more products in this line.",2
"Moisturizing? Yes, but sticky almost uncomfortable. Left my lips smooth :) I also bought some for sister, she loves it!",1
"It’s pretty good, my skin loves this, but I think it’s too expensive for what comes inside of the bottle.",1
"I love the fact that the Bareminerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum is vegan and has a clean formula. The sample that I had was very small, but I really liked the serum. It is not oily and it absorbs quickly. It leaves your skin very soft and hydrated.",2
I received this product for free as a tester. I love it! My skin has never felt softer and it looks amazingly moisturized. My favorite part about this is that a little bit goes a long way! Definitely will be purchasing in the future.,2
LA LA LOVE THIS! Keeps my skin smooth and glowing! Would definitely recommend to my friends!,2
"The pitera essence is an extra step you can add if you want to be luxurious in your routine. It prepped my skin for serums, but did not dry it out. I found that it didn’t do anything extra special as far as making you glowy or anything, but just helps get some extra moisture especially when you use drying actives.",1
"Okay I love this essence. Thanks to Influenster I got to add this product to my daily skincare routine. Over the last month of use my face has been more moisturized and appears softer, smoother and more radiant. I truly believe this helps the efficacy of my serums more than my original essence. From day one I’ve been hooked and know I will be purchasing when I run out. Highly recommend!",2
"Moisturizers should feel like a drink of water for your skin. This one just sits there and feels heavy and greasy. My skin is oily, and I use this overnight because I use my SPF during the day. When I wake up I still feel the greasiness of this formula and it’s such a pleasure to wash it off in the morning. I’ll stick with my $7.99 drugstore moisturizer TYVM.",0
"SO BAD TERRIBLE FOR ACNE PRONE SKIN.  This is the worst my skin has looked in years and it’s all because of this product, I am returning it today.  Would not recommend for combination skin. ( this also contains fragrance which is not a good ingredient for skincare )",0
I feel like there are better masks out there. This one is very light. I like a scrub or heavier mask I think but that’s my preference. It does have a nice Rose essence.,0
I received this as a free sample in exchange for my honest review. This serum is soooooo super hydrating! My fine lines and wrinkles have disappeared! It is a true miracle worker and I love it!! The slight scent is pleasant and definitely not overpowering.  My face feels so soft and refreshed after using this serum. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great wrinkle serum. #trywithtopbox #freeproduct,2
"I received these pads in a points kit that I chose for the face wash only. I was happy when I used them that they didn’t irritate my skin at all, which is sensitive, and surprised when they cleared up the hormonal breakouts I get around my eye since having my second child. I swipe them right underneath my eyes on that delicate skin and NOTHING gets irritated ever and they are the only thing that helps with this odd skin situation I have now. They are soaked in product and I might try cutting them in half as another person suggested, and even though I don’t much like the $40 price tag, I keep buying them. They’re so worth it.",2
I’ve always had very dry lips and this was the only product that really worked. I really love it,2
"If it weren’t for the price, I’d always have this in my bathroom. The price is the only thing that kept this from being a 5 star product. My skin has never felt better after a mask than this one, and even though it stings a bit when it’s working, its a good sting that makes you feel like it’s working well.",1
"i absolutely love this cleaner, it’s so hydrating and makes my skin look so smooth. you only need a small amount, the tiniest amount goes a long wayyy.",2
I received this product to try out and first and foremost it gets a check for being cruelty free. I like the texture of the serum it’s pretty silky but also not so thin that you question if it even work. After applying I let it sit and felt half of my face that I put it on and I can say it is smooth and you also don’t feel like you’re wearing anything. My boyfriend has told me my face has been glowing lately. I’m excited to see the long term results!,2
Silicone mess! Sadly this was a big miss. I hate sillocones and didn’t realize this was just a silicone spf. Clogged pores everywhere. It just reminded me of a primer. Not a moisturizer by any means.,0
I recently started using Bobbi Brown’s Vitamin Enriched Face Base Moisturizer and I am impressed. It served as a moisturizer and a primer so you can reduce the amount of products you have to layer under your makeup. It has shea butter and Vitamin C so my skin is left feeling mousirzed and bright. It does leave a little white film on my brown skin but it goes away after a few minutes,1
"I have combination skin that is very acne prone, though it’s not particularly sensitive. I bought this mask and used it every day for 5 days and now use it every second or third day along with a cream exfoliant. My skin is not perfect yet, but it’s the best skin I’ve had in a while. Also, this brand is available on Etsy but it’s more expensive AND they charge you for shipping...just thought you guys should know.",2
"This is the best day cream that I have ever tried, and I feel like I’ve tried them all! Like a cool drink of water for your skin, absorbs and never greasy or sticky, nice fresh scent too. I have combo skin, this is perfect.",2
"I now have this in 4 scents and this is my least favorite. Nothing is “bad” I just don’t get much mint or chocolate. The formula is wonderful, but don’t get it for the flavor or scent.",1
Absolutely love this product!! I love to mix it with my moisturizer or spf! It is perfect for no makeup days to give you some color and glow!,2
"I really love how well this takes off all of my makeup at night. I am pretty lazy about wanting to wash my face at night, but this takes off the eye makeup and everything else quickly and easily. I also like that I feel like it is moisturizing my skin rather than drying it out at night.",2
"I’ve been a long time fan of the translucent color, so when this one came out I knew I just had to try it, and boy was I happy. I was slightly worried that the color would be similar to the rose color in the normal lip treatment, but it wasn’t at all. The color reminds me of that look of freshly scrubbed lips - like a little pink and full. It’s not overpowering - it’s just a hint of pink to brighten up the face. I’ll definitely be getting more so that I can keep some at my desk too. It doesn’t have a long staying power, but I like to use it right before I pop out for a quick weekend errand or something.",2
"This product has helped to reduce the puffiness of the bottom of the eyes. Now that I am in my 30s, I was definitely seeing more bags, so I was very happy that this product actually worked. The cream is very moisturizing and it applies very smoothly.",2
This is the only face moisturizer I can use. It’s gentle and doesn’t break my sensitive face out. I have been using this face lotion forever now and have yet to find something that compares. Highly recommended!,2
Super runny consistency and didn’t notice a difference in my skin. Maybe I would have to use the product for a longer period time. i did receive for free for trial purposes.,0
"Not the absolute best moisturizer I’ve ever tried but it gets the job done, very simple and non irritating",1
"Love this profuct! Got on sale for Black Friday, better products for price, but if you can get on sale definitely recommend!",2
"There’s several different “can of water“ mists. Caudalie’s is grape water, which is full of antioxidants, although I’m not sure how far they are going to get into the skin. Very confusing for this to be marketed as a “moisturizing“ mist. This is not moisturizing on its own, it is literally water. Ofc you can use it to wet your face for serums, but is there really THAT much benefit from this specific water? To be honest... I filled a refillable mist bottle with spring water and liked it better. Maybe I’d get a little can again for traveling or something...but this is an aerosol so it cannot go on planes.",0
"I got this as a sample in the Sephora play box and while it doesn’t help with sebaceous filaments at all, it definitely helps with acne prone skin and pimples. I even had my partner, who has very acne prone skin, try it and the results on him were amazing. However, do not use on open sores or cuts because it will burn.",2
This product is great when you need an extra pick me up in the middle of your week! Love using a chemical exfoliant and It leaves you skin glowing the next day!,1
"This is decent moisturizer. There’s just nothing special about it. For the price, you could be buying medic grade skincare. Or save some money and buy something just good like the la roche-posay toleriane for 1/3 of the price.",0
I got a chemical reaction from this product. I have 32 bumps all over my face. I kept this simple so you don’t get bored reading and I hope you do t buy this product or at least do a patch test. Cause I’m not paying for it. I’ll never buy a first aid product again.,0
It doesn’t clean as well as I thought it would but it serves it’s purpose and was gentle on my dry skin. I pair this with first aid beauty moisturizer my skin has never been better.,1
"I received a sample of this through Topbox and wasn’t sure what to think of it.  This was a very different kind of product, I was skeptical at first because it said I could use this ALONE if I have combo skin (which I do).  I tried for a couple of weeks to use it in my day and night routine, not using a regular moisturizer but used only this and an eye cream. Surprisingly, my skin was not parched, and I woke up with super soft and pleasantly hydrated skin!  Definitely recommend for those who have combo/oily skin who is looking for a light day to day moisturizer!",2
"Where has this been my whole life? My skin instantly felt refreshed, and appeared younger, I looked more balanced. In one use!! What?! Best part is a little bit goes a long way, which is nice with the higher price point. Simply a perfect item for keeping skin feeling and looking awesome",2
"Didn’t work as well as I wanted it to. A lot of people really liked this product, and I thought I would too, but it did nothing for my skin except leave it kinda sticky. Wasn’t a fan.",0
"I only tried it once n it was awesome. My face was really red n it gets better after using it once n it was really smooth. This might be the best thing I’ve ever used. It doesn’t smell the best, but the result is unreal",2
I have the targeted combo to oily and acne prone skin. This product works pretty well with a salicylic acid exfoliant and basic moisturizer as it did help clear the majority of my acne daily well. The reason I am giving it a 3/5 is because I don’t know how well it would work by itself with no treatment for a specific concern.,1
This moisturizer is incredible! My skin is normally very dry and finding a moisturizer that deeply moisturizes is very challenging. This one left my skin feeling so refreshed and hydrated! It is very light on the skin and does not make your skin look oily. I love this!!,1
Thiss facewash is the only facewash that I will use routinely other than my PROACTIV when I break out. I love this wash.,2
Love that this is great for the ocean! I am not to fond of the smell though! I think it’s an okay product for the price.,1
This is very gentle cleanser. My skin feels so smooth after using this cleanser,2
"Omg! This product’s smells so good. After I used it, my skin felt and look so clean and awakened. I use a lot of makeup on daily basis and When I clean my face with other products my face never feels this clean. I definitely recommend it.",2
"For those saying it’s thick and hard to put on, you’re doing it wrong. Follow the box instructions and dab a tiny amount on two fingertips and then press them against the fingertips on your other hand to warm up. The consistency will change and become more liquid and then you can put it on. A tiny amount can be used to completely hydrate the face. The 2 oz jar lasts me well over a year normally. Also, my skin is flawless from it. I’ve used it for 10 years and I’m almost 40 and still have smooth and young skin. I’ll let La Mer take the credit!",2
"After using for a week I noticed a difference. Although it’s a bit oily for me   I do love the feel and smell , and the noticeable difference",2
"After the first purchase of this wonder salve I was hooked! I think I got a free one with a promotion and had no idea how wonderful it would be. The scent has a very light rose scent and it goes on thick and creamy and is the only thing that has helped my eternally chapped lips! Cute tin, long lasting and wonderful smelling. What more could you want?!",2
"I received this product as complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster and I was amazed! I noticed results the first day I used it, my skin felt much softer. With more use I noticed that it helped my skin lock in moisture because I wasn’t being that oily during the day. I have also noticed that my skin is evening out in skin tone and hopefully soon I’ll see more radiance.  Definitely recommend even though it is pricey but worth it!",2
This product is smooth and beautiful. It feels great and is amazing beneath makeup or on its own. It helps smooth the area but it is so pricey for what it is.,1
I love this moisturizer sooo much! It is my holy grail. This moisturizer is best for oily skin types because it is soo lightweight. This doesn’t break me out or make me super oily throughout the day. I love this brand of overall.,2
"Price point is definitely the best but I dont love the product. Tough to get out of the tube, leaves a funny feeling on the skin (although that went away once I did my double cleanse with something else) and it smells not great.",0
"So great! I have really dry skin, but this leaves my under eyes so plump and moisturized. And it doesn’t irritate my eyes at all. LOVE!",2
Love this toner. It’s light and doesn’t dry out our skin at all and the smell is fresh and sweet. I visibly noticed my skin more refreshed and glows after using this! I received this from influenster,2
"I love this moisturizer!!! It’s so simple, no fuss cream that really makes your skin supple and smooth, especially the more you use it. I feel a slight tingle when I first apply it, which I personally really like. I apply it heavily at night, and a few mornings if I happen to feel that I need some extra moisture. I have acne prone combination to dry skin and no breakouts from this! Love it after trying the .94 ounce jar, plan on repurchasing one of the bigger sizes ❤️",2
"This product does work ok as a moisturizer though the moisture does not appear to last very long. I have not noticed a plumping, I used to use lip plumpers but wanted something more like a balm and this does not really have the same effect. Smells nice though and does not feel sticky or thick.",1
"I have struggled with acne from a young age and have tried many different products to clear my breakouts. My mom suggested trying Clinique products, and I went for the facial soap, this clarifying lotion, and the moisturizing lotion. I noticed an immediate difference in my face! I will continue to buy these products because of the incredible results I got. One thing to note is that this clarifying lotion can be a but drying, make sure to buy the moisturizing lotion!",2
"A Sephora rep sold me on it but it’s day 3 for me and I’m not sure if I love it yet. I want to give it some more time, plus I’m layering it with Tatcha moisturizer which I do love... so we’ll see",1
"Overall I like this product! It is on par with the other beauty cleansing balms, non irritating, feels good on my skin and has an amazing smell. Comes with a ton of product! I received this product free for testing purposes",1
"I’ve been using this for about a month now, and love the way it leaves me skin clear! I usually have redness in my skin, but after washing my face with this, my face is clean and clear! gentle enough, but effective.",2
I have full skin and was looking for a good serum like this. I also have some dark spots that look much better after using this serum. My skin feels a lot more firm and my skin tone looks more even than before.Gifted by Drunk Elephant,2
"Oh PTR, another great product. These are a bit strong for me to use everyday -- I use them every other, and only on my t-zone. But they are very effective and I notice a difference (clearer pores, happier skin) after only a few days with or without. Smells a heck of a lot better than an Oxy pad too!",2
"I usually don’t like lip balms where you use your fingers, but I am in love. It keeps your lips feeling nice and smooth and smells amazing, even guys ask me to use it. I really can’t get enough of it.",2
I received this product complimentary from goop. I thought that the over nite mask was amazing. it made my face feel super soft and I had the most amazing glow. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I will be buying more. Thank you for the opportunity to try your product,2
"This will be my third bottle of this stuff! My sister and I have been using this cleanser for about 9 months now and have noticed a big change in both of our skin. You can check out my sisters IG account: Raquellyss she has a post on her skin and how it’s changed. For myself I don’t have a big problem with acne, mine is more with texture and with this cleanser I’ve noticed that my skin is much smoother and my only breakouts are when its that time of the month. I would definitely recommend it",2
"I definitely recommend this serum! Ive been using it fpr a few weeks now and i can tell theres a difference in my skin, its more glow and looks much more healthy. The serum is very watery so i do recommend only using two pumps believe me thats more than enough for your whole face.",2
"A little greasy. I don’t think I wear enough makeup to warrant this. Also, too hard to use for me. I’m a squirt my soap in my hand kinda girl.",1
"I like this product, I just really don’t like the scent. This wears so well under makeup and is really moisturizing, but the citrus scent is way too strong. I also don’t like that they used essential oils in the product, as that can be really irritating for sensitive skin. If they came out with a fragrance free version, I would be all over that. I also wish the packaging was glass. This is really expensive, so I would expect the packaging to be more luxurious.",1
"the best lip balm/gloss, good for cuticles, scrapes, etc...",2
I love the texture of this eye cream - it starts out as a balm and just melts into the skin. It’s perfect for under concealer and I’ve seen improvements in fine lines after continued use. I received this product free for testing purposes.,2
"I love this sunscreen! It goes on like your fave weightless serum, obviously it’s clear (and that’s amazing!) and it won’t move your makeup around if you need to reapply mid day. Love, love, love!",2
"this is a VERY active product. tingling and flushing after use, but those dissipate pretty quickly. i can’t imagine using it every day (i use it 3-4x/week). but when i do use it i really like the results - plump, refined, exfoliated skin.",1
"I bought the Green Tea wipes and i love them! They are very helpful for small pimples that are about to turn ugly, basically wipes them away. Would recommend.",2
"I was so excited to try this, because just over the last year or so I’ve started noticing undereye puffiness that’s worst in the mornings. I also have rosacea, and I’ve heard that caffeine can be useful for that, too, since it’s a vasoconstrictor. Well, I tried this several times--varying the amounts I used and whether I used it alone or with other products, as well as time of day--and it never produced a visible result for me. It DID deposit a thin, grainy white film on my skin in direct proportion to how much product I used. And it was very drying. Also did nothing for rosacea pinkness when applied to my cheeks. In the past I had a stainless steel rollerball caffeine serum from a drugstore that worked better, but I always suspected it was the cold steel ball, in combination with some liquid evaporating that would make the skin even cooler--and now I’m tempted to just get a steel roller to try. I’m debating whether to just toss what’s left of the bottle, because it was so ineffective I can’t really imagine using it again.",0
"Love it. Have used it for a little under a year. It keeps my skin looking nice overnight, and doesn’t cause breakouts.",2
"Recently Goop gifted me their very unique and highly effective GOOPGLOW Microderm Instant Glow Exfoliator promising to be a ‘ a powerful facial in a little jar’. I’ve already tried it few times and absolutely enjoyed the ritual itself and the glowing results. The texture is the most enjoyable, lightweight and whipped; it contains a lot of super tiny fine-powdered particles from microexfoliating minerals (quartz, garnet, alumina, and silica) in conjunction with  highly effective glycolic acid providing an additional chemical exfoliation of dead skin cells and making skin softer and smoother. After each treatment my skin looks incredible healthy and bright, smooth to touch and with beautiful glowing. And I never experienced any irritation or redness which is so important for sensitive skin owners.",2
This works pretty well. I think Farmacy green clean works a bit better though and the smell.... this makes me nauseous where green clean is fresh and clean smelling. I will be returning this purely because I just cannot handle the smell. it smells like animal fat to me.,1
"I bought the Berry one a year ago and it has been my favorite lip gloss! I don’t like wearing anything else if it’s not my berry gloss. However, I recently lost it (I was short on it anyway) so I purchased the peach one. Needless to say, I’m not as happy. I should’ve repurchased Berry, but I want to try all the scents out. Peach just DIDN’T do it AT ALL! Has no scent whatsoever!!! Don’t purchase it!! Go w BERRY :) But it’s okay, so long as it gets my lips hydrated & moisturized.",1
"I read some reviews that said it helped with their breakouts, I wasn’t very hopeful but I need an extra kick of moisture in my night routine so I have it a shot. Guyyyssss..I’m so glad I did. I noticed my skin started to clear up after just a few days, and after using it for a couple months my skin looks the best it has in so long. I’m so happy! And the price point!? Amazing, nothing to lose.",2
"At the start of the application (during exfoliation) I really enjoyed this. My skin is a bit sensitive for the 15% lactic acid, so it burned a bit. I did not like the way this product felt on my face after application, it felt very heavy and very stick and uncomfortable. I ended up rinsing it off after 10 minutes. However, I did like the way my skin felt and the way it glowed the next morning.",1
Cannot live without it! My skin has firmed up and cleared from white heads in couple of weeks of using it. I was able to stop using intense AHA   BHA peels and completely switched to this cleanser.  I had to also invest into an good (and expensive) sunscreen (instead of just regular sunscreen) because of the danger of pigmentation that comes with using any AHA   BHA based products... which is fine because sunscreen is extremely important even if you don’t use acids in your routine.,2
My pores have gone smaller after using this it is worth it ! I have added this after double cleansing. I have never had something work fast and this good on my skin. I used the whole travel side bottle in 3 months it’s worth it!,2
Great improved formula! Shake before use to ensure mixed well. No white residue and great with sweat resistance on a run. Doesn’t leave a greasy residue,1
"This product feels almost like satin on your skin... it absorbs super well, does not leave a sheen or residue or white cast, and actually feels more like skincare than sunscreen. Tons of product in the bottle, will likely just use on my face. Makeup sits well over it too! Really like this.",2
Thai formula is a noticeable improvement from the original (already great) advanced night repair.,2
not my favorite. This serum works well but I have a few issues with it. 1. it is very sticky and doesn’t feel like a high end and expensive formulation. 2. The smell is bad. it smells typical for unscented vitamin c ( like metallic hot dog water). 3. it is very expensive and doesn’t last long. I got to try this complimentary through influenster.,0
"I love this lip mask. Living in New England, the winters dry out my lips a lot. I used lip balm regularly but my lips would still be cracked and even bleed once in a while. This lip mask was a life saver. Helped my lips and kept them soft and moisturized.",2
I love this product! Is the best for my face!I believe this must be suitable for everyone!,2
Picked up the mini size of this and I LOVE IT!! I use it along with my nightly skincare routine whenever my skin needs a little pick-me-up or I need to clear up a pimple. IT WORKS! looks great in the morning. Definitely will repurchase,2
"I love Clinique’s DDML. I’ve used it for 45 years. I have tried to replace it with other moisturizers along the way, but nothing works as well. It’s great for night and day, and it works especially well under makeup. I have normal skin with a tendency to contact dermatitis. There are certain ingredients I can’t use. DDML has never caused problems. It is fragrance free. I also use the Clinique mild bar soap for cleansing. I’ve never found anything to replace that, either. A lot of cleansers (for example, Cetaphil) give me a rash. In the worst months of winter, I sometimes use Moisture Surge Intense over this. People still compliment me on my skin. I have very few lines, smooth texture, and I don’t have enlarged pores. One caveat, know your skin type! Cleansers and moisturizers are geared to skin type. If you have oily skin, this will probably be too much moisture.",2
"Argan oil is fantastic - my acne prone skin does not break out, and my dry winter skin is smooth, silky, and best of all, hydrated! Eczema on arms - gone. Light citrus scent is inoffensive. This is my new winter go-to product.",2
"I am 32 and have had acne and large pores since my teen years. I have even been on Retin A. I cried a lot and used every kind of concealer. I thought maybe I’ll try a peel and try to resurface my skin. I was right! Price is no object for helping dry up my acne, get skin compliments which I never have had ,shrink huge pores, and ease up on makeup especially in my 30s. Wow!",2
For the time I used it seemed to be ok. Made me break out a little bit. Too expensive for my taste.,1
"I love love love this salve. I’ve been using it on my lips before bed at night. Usually I have flaky, peely lips no matter how much chapstick I use. This stuff has completely cured me of that problem. I will never be without a tin of this ever again.",2
"I have dehydrated oily skin so I was a little nervous about trying this out .. but I’m so glad I did. It does smell VERY rosey, but it’s easy to apply and feels very good.",2
"I enjoy this product. I love exfoliating m face with it. I love the little pieces of beads that feel like sand, I feel like it takes away all the the dirt, dead skin. After a nice warm rinse m face feels so clean, clear and smooth. I definitely recommend this product, which I received complimentary from Influenster.",2
"This water cream is a nice smooth anti-aging botanical cream that helps reduce pore size and control excess oil. Great to use before make-up application. I love this whole line of TATCHA skin care, my skin looks better than it ever did and these products contain natural ingredients that do not contain parabens and sulfates, This is worth the price, I have never experienced a reaction to any of these products! .",2
"Lately I’ve added chemical peels to my skincare routine which can really be harsh -- raw, red skin, sometimes rough from dry patches -- and I always follow with Creme de La Mer afterwards.  It’s super thick, but soothing.  Instead of rubbing it between my hands, I just swipe a streak on each cheek and my forehead, wait a minute for my face to heat it up, then gently massage it in.  That way I don’t feel like I’m wasting product.",2
"It’s not like anything you can get at the drugstore. It is so invigorating and refreshing. I use it everyday. Apricot scrub cannot even compare. If you’re on the fence about an oily/combination skin scrub, this is definitely worth at least a try!",2
"I bought this product in store and when I opened the box there was a few peels that inside didn’t have the peels and that was one thing but the next thing was I was sold a product WITH MOLD. As you can see below in the videos and pictures. I contacted Sephora and they didn’t care at all and didn’t compensate or help me in anyway I’m really disappointed that Sephora would sell me and maybe even a different customer not only a damaged product but a product with MOLD. Please be careful ladies and check before purchasing. Definitely re thinking of to continue to a be a rouge, I received horrible customer service and nothing was done.",0
Tones down all my redness and gives a little coverage. I love it.,2
"Loved how it felt on the skin, perfect to incorporate into your nighttime routine.",1
Great wipes for a great price. I love how you can exfoliate your skin with the wipe!,2
I love me some serums!!!! anything that can help my skin and make me the fountain  of  youth is the best !!!! But I didn’t like the fact I had to mix two to make one. It was a bit oily but dried fast. It did give a glow to my skin. I was only able to use this for a few days before my skin started to break out. If that didn’t happen I am sure it would be great. I would recommend this to everyone even though it didn’t work for me.,1
"Thanks to Influenster for this product! This is a great product to add to my skincare routine! It has a great texture that is smoothe on the skin and hydrating. Like other reviewers wrote, it can seem to feel dry because of the matte finish, but with a good serum during the day and night cream to finish in the evenings, it’s a great product! I wouldn’t definitely recommend it more for summer use, but it’s a great product that I’ve enjoyed using so far.",1
Love how hydrating and soothing this lip balm is. This is perfect for winter when the lips are chapped and you want something to soothe them. I recommend the mint version because it leaves a cooling sensation on the lips.,2
"Really impressed. I typically like a more gritty exfoliant, but my skin has become too sensitive to use those. I wasnt sure if this would do enough, but it helps the texture of my skin SO much. Its so surprising how well it works with such a fine texture and minimal abrasion. Wonderful scrub for sensitive skin! The small size lasted me around 3-4 months, i assume the large is closer to a year supply No detectable fragrance either, which i love.",2
"Wow, I didn’t think it was possible but apparently this product is too heavy for me.  I’ve been using it for 6 weeks now and for those 6 weeks I keep getting tiny little zits all around my face.  Nothing big or painful, thank goodness, but they keep popping up every few days which is highly unusual for me as I typically only get zits the week before my period and then only on the lower third of my face. My skin has always been tolerant of pretty much anything I slap onto it (I don’t think I’ve ever had a product that broke me out before), so I almost don’t what about this cream is breaking me out.  I’ve used thicker, more occlusive creams before without issue and nothing in the ingredients list that jumps out as potentially problematic.  I’ve kept using it for weeks because I kept hoping my skin would acclimate and because the zits have been so small that they’re practically invisible after I pop the head so they’ve been more of a nuisances than a big concern, but I’m ready to throw in the towel.  This cream has done a good job keeping the dryness and flaking I’ve had from using tretinoin at bay, but I’m ready to move on to a product that can do that job without clogging my pores.",1
This is my favorite cleanser. It is gentle on my skin and makes me feel clean and refreshed,2
"Goop Glow gifted me this amazing exfoliator through Octoly! The first thing that is very important is not to use a whole bunch of the product. A little goes a long way. The micro beads feels like magic on your face without causing any irritation. My skin has always been the dry type and after using this product, it brings so much more life to my skin!",2
"I can’t give this enough stars.  It may be pricey, but my skin is not the same without it.  The roughness of my neck is now smooth.  My face is no longer blotchy and dry.  It’s like having new skin.I can’t say enough about this.  If you spend lots of money on various cremes and serums, save some $ and invest into this.  Love the other products in this line as well.",2
I loved this product right away! The texture and smell were fantastic and it left my skin feeling so refreshed. What I loved most though was that I could use it as a makeup remover (even with eye makeup!) and face cleanser too! Definitely my new favorite.,2
My face can be weird with cleansers sometimes.. I have real fussy combo skin but every since I started using this cleanser 3 years ago my life done CHANGED. Then I started double cleansing with an oil cleanser and then FAB and it has made even further a difference. And it lasts FOREVER. You literally only need a pea sized amount. It’s great.,2
"It was very hydrating and my skin felt nourished all day! The issue I had was that it doesn’t dry down much/at all, so my hair kept sticking to my face and pillow when i tried to go to bed. The smell is also very strong, and not my favourite. (I received this product complimentary as part of a campaign)",1
"Moisturizing effectI normally use a matryxl 3000 serum to add moisture to my skin.  When I received Clinique moisture surge as a tester free of charge from Influenster to review I switched my matryxl for this. It was incredibly light and hydrating and I was amazed. It was so lightweight but instantly hydrating at the same time. Though my usual products sink in after a bit, I’ve never had such instant results. Not greasy nor oily, I’m greatly considering adding this to normal my daily routine.",2
I got this complimentary  from La Mer“ and I absolutely love it.It has a small smell to it which is tolerable but it makes my face feel so smooth and soft.Also you don’t need much cream it goes a long way. Only con I have is that its pricey..,2
Love the natural feel on your face like its water cleansing you. The burst of fresh floral hint is so uplifting in the morning. Im definitely not a peppy morning person but I feel like I could be with this product. Only downfall is the products despenser. Do not like the Spout at all. Feels wasteful. Less Convientant and feels like I spend just a little more time being careful not to spill this precious skin care booster. I would like a spritz upgrade on this.,1
"This is one of the best lip balms I’ve ever used. As a long time Burt’s Bee’s chapstick addict, I must admit this does an even better job of healing my lips, especially overnight. And it does it without the same level of “tingle,“ which some people don’t enjoy.If you’re trying to heal your super dry lips, cut down on the peeling, and get rid of sores/redness from drying out (and occasional night drool, lol), then this is the best.",2
Love this clay mask! Makes my skin feel so tight afterwards without feeling dry! Also great for reducing big pores!,2
Love!!! This smells absolutely amazing like lemongrass. It is so gentle but takes off all my makeup and keeps the skin hydrated.,2
LOVE this mask!! I use this throughout the day and it gives you soft and smooth shiny lips! Also smells great :),2
"My boyfriend loves it, this is his third tube. It’s completely matte and really moisturizes for the long term. He only really reapplies once or twice at most after things like eating and drinking. He will only use the original mint one though, didn’t really like the one that smelled like lemon.",1
Feels good but I don’t see much of a difference after using it,1
Great for moisturing either on its own or mixed in with a favorite lotion,2
"This stuff right here.....This stuff right here is the bomb. I spend a nice chunk of change for my facial cream, and it does not even compare to this stuff. I was blown away about how nice, light, and soft it made my skin feel. I used it before my makeup and i have to say it does not leave any oily residue and it makes my makeup look and stay much better. I have already recommended this to my mother and i will definitely be buying this for myself in the future. I highly recommend anybody to go ahead and give this a try, you wont be sorry.",2
This stuff is amazing. I was suffering with dry under eye skin with the cold winter weather. Using All About Eyes Rich for a few days and my under eye skin was so much better. It feels so rich and really hydrates! Will definitely be buying more when I run out.,2
"This removes makeup unlike anything else I’ve tried, and it doesn’t clog my pores or feel too heavy. I love that water is enough to remove the product, a washcloth isn’t necessary unlike other cleansing balms. I’ve already repurchased, although I’m still working through my first tub since you only need a little bit. This is why Drunk Elephant is the best.",2
"I’ll use this up because I paid for it. But like everyone said, it’s super thick and doesn’t work as easily as my former Fresh or Caudalie ones do. It takes effort and then I’m still using another remover to get what’s still left on my eyes. Smells absolutely wonderful and like a few others stated, every time I somehow get some in my mouth and it takes like poison. Doesn’t work well enough for the cons, won’t repurchase.",0
Luv this sunscreen. I have oily skin and this SPF makes my skin feel like silk.  ❤️,2
"Love this! It’s very moisturizing, and I feel like it lasts without being greasy or sticky or anything like that. There is no odor - big plus as someone who gets triggered for migraines that way. And I can use it all over my body including my face without breaking out. I have super dry skin on my body and combination skin on my face - but mostly dry, and it doesn’t make me more oily in those areas. I can’t imagine using something else after this. Just wish it came in the 8 oz size in a jar, because you can get more out that way than a squeeze tube!",2
"I was pretty skeptical of this product but it actually works! I have naturally tan skin but I prefer a little more color, especially in the winter. The bottle recommends 1-12 drops so I gave 6 a try on my first go. Mind you, this was just for my face. To give you an idea, my face was considerably darker than my chest within 6 hours. Whoops. You should also wash your hands immediately after applying because my palms are all brown now. My only complaint is the smell.",1
"So I was dying to try drunk elephant. I got this in my Influenster kit and holy CRAP is my skin clean. I broke out initially But that’s normal. Once the initial skin irritation faded, this did a number on my pores. I used to have serious blackheads on my nose and now I have clear and soft skin. 10/10",2
"This is one of my favorite cleansing balms. I’m a huge fan of the double cleanse process and usually I use cleansing oil. I got a sample of this after I made a purchase at Sephora and it was a game changer. It’s easier to control than cleansing oil because it starts off as a balm but it turns into oil. Oil attracts oil and other impurities so is it a great start to the cleansing process. I follow up with a water-based cleanser. I also love farmacy balm as well. I purchased both for different reasons. For me the Clinique one is best when you have on really heavy makeup because it’s heavy duty and gets literally everything off. However the farmacy brand starts off creamier so  I enjoy the texture a bit more and the ingredients are better. I definitely grab the clinique one when I need to go to work, meaning when I’m wearing a lot of makeup. I use them both in rotation and I’m loving both of them. I highly recommend both brands, the farmacy is best for your light to normal makeup days, the clinique one is for the days when you’re wearing a fully beat-face that you went to work on.",2
Love this product. Super light weight and works well with my oily skin. I use this in the AM and PM.,2
Perfect for winter dryness. A bit thick at first but soaks in after a while.,2
"Amazing for combo/oily skin! A little goes a long way, love this product!",2
I’ve tried so many makeup melters out there and nothing compares to this one!!!!!! So so so easy to use and apply! Besides that it doesn’t irritate my skin or break me out! I have normal acne prone along and very sensitive. If I use the world product (doesn’t matter skincare or makeup) my skin easily will breakout the next day! Anyways this product breaks down your makeup so effortlessly and easily. I normally take it off with a damp cloth and it comes off like I dream in literally 10 seconds!!!!! I literally just bought my third run of this stuff!!!!! It’s a game changer in my routine!!!,2
"I got this because if felt so smooth on my hand when I tried it in the store. Once I put it on my face, it made it so dry and caused my foundation to look cakey. On the plus side, there was no white cast but this isn’t something I would ever use again.",0
I absolutely love this product! I’ve been using it for only two weeks and my skin is definitely visibly smoother I always had an issue with tiny bumps under my skin that I could never get rid of and it seems like this product has exceeded my expectations. It’s truly so affordable and I would re-purchase again in a heartbeat. My facialist recommended that I use an enzyme exfoliants but the products at their salon were so expensive I’m really glad I found one at Sephora,2
"This has been a part of my morning routine off and on for years. I may stray for a while and try something new, but I always come back to my faithful standby in te yellow bottle. My skin is on the dry side, and this moisturizer really penetrates and moisturizes skin. It sinks right in, leaves no oily residue, and makes my skin soft. I will continue to purchase indefinitely.",2
"PEACE OUT Acne Healing Dots are really good at reducing the swelling of bumps and acne that pops up out of nowhere. I think they are great for to have on hand for travel, vacation, etc. They work best overnight but even if you have a breakout and want to treat it at least 4-6 hours prior to prepping for your day/event then that’s good too.",1
I like the way this feels.  Very moisturizing.  Only 4 stars since i haven’t used it long enough to see if it makes a difference.,1
this product has made my hands  face and neck ORANGEToo pricey for 30ml Leaves orange spots on the hand after washing it 5 times with soap,0
This was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. This is so gentle on the skin and instantly you can feel a difference after using.  I love the brightness that it gives my skin. This is the perfect gentle exfoliant for every day use! I definitely recommend.,2
I received this cleanser for free to sample and I absoulty love love love it I will be buying it since I love the way my face felt after ❤️,2
This is nice it burns a little but I would say instant results. I like this a lot.,2
Loved this product. It felt kinda itchy at the beginning but nothing to worry about,2
"This oil is absolutely amazing. I’ve been using it now for about three weeks and I can already see a HUGE difference in my skin. I have always had oily, breakout prone skin. This argan oil has evened out my skin tone, stopped any blemishes, and actually seems to be controlling oiliness. It is worth every penny. All that you need is just a small drop so the bottle lasts for a fairly long time and then I just rub any remaining on my finger tips into my cuticles. I just love this product so much because it multitasks I use it as a moisturizer, blemish treatment, and oil control.",2
"I wish I didn’t love these as much as I do.  They are really expensive for how many “dots“ you get, but they are far better than any other brand of acne patches I have purchased.  They actually stick nicely, they are medicated, and one can see/feel the difference in quality from the generic ones sold on amazon.  I just wish there was a subscribe snd save option, or bulk option to save a little money.",2
"Despite only having used this for the last 7 days now (both morning and night followed by moisturizer), I’m already impressed. My skin looks glowing/brighter, rested, more plump, and generally just better overall. Even later on the same day as the very first application I could see a subtle difference in how my skin appears. It hasn’t made any difference to texture or pores but I honestly didn’t expect it to, going by the ingredients list, and after all that’s what my Retinoids, AHA/BHA are there for. I experience zero stickiness when using 1 pump, but I do notice that sticky after feel others have mentioned if I use 2-3 pumps worth, as per the directions on the product. Yes it is pricey, it smells like a frying pan to my nose but personally I don’t mind what it smells like when the results are this good! The packaging and product overall is beautiful to look at but aesthetics can sometimes be at the cost of functionality...in this case the pump system is a bit fiddly and sometimes won’t dispense properly which can be frustrating. Also I try and avoid fragrance in skincare andwould have been a lot happier if this was fragrance-free. In short:it has its minor downfalls (the price being No1!) but its saving grace is its ingredients, everything from peptides to niacinamide, proven ingredients that help the condition and appearance/function of your skin. A bit of a splurge, but one I might just indulge in again.~ My Sephora Top 7 must-have list ~(My top 7 must-have beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Sephora)1. Hair Loss Treatment: ‘Divine Herbal’ - Hair Oil2. Shampoo: ’Sephora Collection’ - Deep Cleaning Shampoo3. Face Mask: ‘Peter Thomas Roth’ – Pumpkin Enzyme Mask4.

"Suffering from mild/moderate acne I noticed when using this that if I am breaking out with a pimple at night, if I used this, by the time I wake up in the morning the pimple is either non-existent or greatly reduced in size. I do however wish more came in the box because of its price. I have been using this for about a month now and I have seen some noticeable changes in the brightness of my skin and texture!",1
For everyone saying “it doesn’t work and it made my skin breakout after a couple of days” that’s called purging it’s cleaning all the dirt from your skin and acne is starting to show purging only last a couple of weeks so if this process last for more than 4 weeks it’s not working for you.,2
One of my favorite face creams ever! Got a sample one time and the moment I put it on my face I felt the difference. Makes my skin feel like a layer of cool hydration has been applied that soaks in quickly and leaves my skin feeling quenched. Doesn’t leave me feeling greasy! I usually use this alone before bed and my skin is always plumper and brighter when I wake up.,2
"I really like this product and how gentle it is to be used more than once a week. It removes dead skin effectively and leaves me skin feeling so soft for days! My only problem that i had with it is that it caused me to break out in some places. With that in mind I don’t think i’ll be purchasing this in the future, but I do recommend it if you’re looking for an ultra gentle scrub.",1
"These are great. Do they get rid of acne over night? No, but they are great at reducing the spot and speeding up the healing time. My only complaint is that they are a bit thick so they are very visible.",1
"I got this as a sample and I’m very glad I did. It’s super greasy and feels so gross. I had to wipe it off. And I have pretty dry skin, everywhere. And I just can’t with this.",0
"I read an article about this stuff and promptly ran out and bought a tube.  #noregrets This was money well spent.  You only need a little bit and you don’t even have to wash it off.  I will use a dab under my eyes before bed sometimes, but it has been a lifesaver this past winter in New Jersey.  I joined a 5 am running group.  I wake up at 4:30 and just rub some of this magic on my sleep wrinkled face an go out and spend an hour in 20-40 degree F temps.  I come home, then wash my face and my skin looks really good.  No breakouts.",2
This lip mask is almost perfect to me I use all the time not just for sleeping I love the smell HOWEVER it does leave a purplish tint on your lips same as packaging maybe if it was a little bit lighter I wouldn’t have notice seeing as I’m a very pale woman and have very light pink lips but still amazing 9/10 a lot of product as well I got this in may I’m not even halfway done and I use it daily(as I said before) also go be noted I have full lips! Enjoy xo,1
"I received this product from influencer to review, I like how it feel on my skin saw a little different after using once, but hoping to see more results after using it more,but for the prize think it should be a little less like $50",2
"I received a sample size of this #freeproduct to try via #tryitwithtopbox. I found this cream to be hydrating, thick and absorbed decently. It seemed to leave skin under my eyes more plump and smoother. In the few days I tried it, I obviously didn’t see any progress but it was a lovely texture and scent. I typically use a dermalogical eye cream and found when I topped this one with my typical moisturizer and sunscreen, I had some issues with makeup in the area. It was a nice cream for a good price point but I’ll be sticking to my usual eye cream for now at least.",1
"I have dry, sensitive skin and I am always open  the hunt for a soothing product. I’ve heard people rave of this product and I decided to give it a go. Let’s break it down.Pros: Lots of product packaged.Almost fragrance free.Compact packaging.Cons: Large surface area= horrible for getting around your under eyes and around your nose.Leaves a sticky film.Moisturizing feeling does not last.OVERALL: this is a novelty item at best. there are better items out there. I’d prefer to just use pure aloe over this. Feels about the same, anyway.",1
"This is by far one of my favorite things in my beauty routine!! I was looking for a calming, all-natural, great cleanser that wouldn’t upset my super reactive sensitive oily acne prone combo skin and this has been the best find! Def HG status for cleansers for me, and I can’t say enough how much it has helped my skin. The smell is amazing (I can’t wait to wash my face in the am and pm!), the gel consistency feels like it really cleans out my pores as the second step in my double cleaning following my farmacy oil cleanser, and it has not caused me to break out or react at all. It’s really hard for me to find products that do all of these things, but I have found my dream cleanser indeed! I will repurchase this again and again and think this will always be my go to cleanser for irritated, dry, and red skin. Buy this-you will not regret it all!",2
"Pretty disappointing.  I primarily bought this to help with dark circles but didn’t see anything more than a slight temporary improvement.  My makeup caked and that really highlighted all my fine lines. Not good! And then to top it off, I experienced the same thing 1 other reviewer also stated. The product ran out very quickly. I pulled the container apart to find a heavy plastic interior with a ton of product left in it. Needless to say I will be cutting it open and using every last drop to get my money’s worth. Then I’m moving on to a different eye cream.",0
The fragrance in this is very strong. It is a nice cream but using it on your eyes every night is a lot and the smell gets annoying. That being said there is a lot of product for the price but I will not be repurchasing.,0
"I really like the Ole Henriksen line as it is. I was super excited to see I was receiving this complimentary from Influenster. So far, I’ve noticed some plumpness in some areas, and I really like the smell and texture. I will add that Influenster wanted me to review sooner than I could wait to see any deep results. I will continue to use this product and report back in a few weeks with my findings.",2
"I’ve used the DDML for years now every morning, and I love it. This new formula I like equally as much, if not more. I’ve only used it a few times now but it sinks in really fast and allows me to put my makeup on within a matter of minutes.",2
I find that this really does hydrate and soften my skin. I have very dry skin (especially in the winter).  I use anywhere from 2 to 3 moisturizers in the morning and at night.  I  thought it would help reduce redness more but I like the hydrating and softening I will be purchasing again to use as part of my routine.,1
"I bought this product after liking the idea that it helped with aging and acne. I’m on my second purchase of this and while I really like it the price bothers me since it is only good for 30 days. However, I bought it again because I have always had small breakouts from hormonal acne that my normal acne products could not 100% clear. After using this consistently for over a month my hormonal acne is almost non-existent and my skin has a clear glow to it in the other areas of my face. I stopped using it about 20 days in the first package I bought thinking it was doing nothing and I started breaking out again. As soon as I started using it again every day my face cleared and was perfect again. I’ll probably keep buying it despite the price since it’s a 2 in 1 product for me and works so well!",1
"Gaaawdddd daaaaang this is moisturizing! I will be using this religiously in the winter. Leaves your face feeling fresh, soft, hydrated and supple.",2
"Thank you to Topbox for providing me with this sample #freeproduct. I found it very lightweight on my face, which allowed me to pair it easily with the Smart Clinical Repair eyecream, and face cream.",1
"I love this! The smell, the texture, the way my lips feels after using it",2
"I’ve been dealing with dry, uneven skin for a while now. This is one of the only products that corrected my dry patches. I bought the smaller size bottle and will be purchasing the bigger one soon!",2
"I have rosacea, and it’s been hard to find a product that can clean my oily, acne-prone skin without causing redness. Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2 is that product. I’m so pleased. It fits in well with my dermatologist-prescribed skincare routine. I’m done with my search, so I hope they never discontinue this product!",2
"This stuff is great. I love that it comes in a tube, its much more sanitary than those little pots of lip balm we all have. Lovely gloss, pretty sheen and a great universal pink shade as well. Great for ’no makeup’ makeup looks and general everyday use",2
"This cleanser is great, since the first try it has madr my skin feel smoother and silky. This is a great everyday cleanser.",2
"My skin tends to react to moisturizers but I’ve been using this one for close to a month with no adverse effects. It works well, and a little product goes a long way!",1
This is magic! I use it btwn my retinoic acid treatments when my dead skin “lifts”. It easily whisks away all my dead skin and impurities leaving my skin looking AMAZING. I’ve never had any irritation from this peel and highly recommend it.,2
"I’m usually not a huge fan of masks I’m encouraged to leave on overnight (think of my clean sheets!) BUT this was wonderful. The product smells incredible, like a childhood candy that I can’t remember the name of but the smell memory is intense, and the texture is so so nice. It goes on feeling like I’ve definitely put on A Mask, but melts into the skin like any good deep moisturizing cream. My skin feels very soft after using it three nights in a row - on a particularly dry day I even used it as my base moisturizer and loved it.",2
"love this. foams up well, cleans the skin, beautiful scent but doesnt dry out my already super dry skin. haven’t used it as a first step so dont know about makeup removal but love it as a second cleanse after my dhc or tatcha oilTIP: initially I used too much but you really dont need much, pump a little and foam it on your hand before applying and you’ll need less!",2
"I felt that this scrub got the job done. My skin feels more smooth and I feel that it helps clear my skin of impurities more often than with a cleanser alone. I only use it about 2-3x a week and I feel that is powerful enough for my combination oily skin. If you buy this, please do not overuse it and definitely do not use it daily. Also it smells nice and not overpowering.",2
"I’m newer to using tanning products, but if looking tan would be as EASY as using these drops, I’ll never be pale again! It takes a little trial and error just to see how many drops you prefer, but once you get it, you’re golden! Literally :) No horrible smell, no rinsing, no streaking. can’t get any easier than that!I will be purchasing the medium drops to try. I got light due to the fact that everyone’s photos on here made the light drops look super intense, but even after using 12 drops in my moisturizer, I want more darkness!",2
"Before buying it, I read reviews that said Vaseline would get the job done just as well, which I think kept me from buying it, considering the price. But vaseline is straight up petrolatum, and Laneige has so many nourishing ingredients that actually work together to hydrate your lips. There are definitely less pricey alternatives out there with similar ingredients, but I just had to buy it because I’ve been eyeing it for way too long. I put some on this morning (around 10 am), it is now 6 pm and I haven’t reapplied anything since. Usually I would have to reapply Vaseline on my lips every 2-3 hours to keep them from chapping, so Laneige really showed me I can go this long without reapplying anything. I’m gonna do the same at night and see how that goes. But so far so good, I would say it was worth it, but I’m probably gonna be hunting for some less pricey products with similar ingredients after this one is done:)",2
very moisture. lip stay moist for a long time. I feel it is also a very natural product.,2
"It definitely plumps up my skin, has a calming/brightening affect (which is crazy to me) and helps with minor textural issues. If you have peeling skin, I think you would be better off with the TLC Framboos from Drunk Elephant. I do a full comparison in my haul video. TLC- evening skin texture and toneGood Genes- fine lines, hydration, brightnessCan’t decide? I just decided to get both, ha!",2
"This product works very well if you can afford it. The scent is not overbearing and the mask does nourish and heal dry lips overnight. I really like it. With that being said it is pricey. If you can’t afford the price, aquaphor advanced therapy healing ointment works just as well in dry lips—It’s just not flavored like this one is nor does it have the cute packaging. I like this product and would repurchase despite the high price point.",2
Not only does this elixir smooth and tighten it leaves your face feeling refreshed and tingly feeling plus cools you down after a workout or shower!,2
I have very fair skin and can easily get dark spots when I don’t have the right sun protection. This sunscreen applies smoothly and does not leave any greasiness on the skin. I let it absorb for about five minutes before beginning applying makeup. It is the perfect barrier throughout the day!,2
"So so good. I am loving the Greek Yoghurt cleanser- it leaves my skin feeling clean and nourished and not the least bit dry. It has a light scent, but I love it!",2
This product is awesome I wpuld recommend to everybody,2
"Amazing make up remover. Comes as a solid a little goes a long way. Rub it in your hands it turns into an oil, removes your make up and then rinse with water. Doesn’t strip the skin and product lasts a long time.",2
"Leaves my skin nice and soft, but have to be very careful to only use minimally and at night as it sometimes leaves an oily residue.",1
"Love this stuff. I’m a serum addict so I was very excited to be chosen to sample Skinlongevity with Influenster! I love how light and refreshing it is on my skin.  I Used the product daily, morning and night for the last few weeks. No reactions or breakouts.  I followed with a good moisturizer.   Didn’t notice any issues with my makeup routine either. I do notice a slight glow when I use it during the day. Again really love this. If you have sensitive skin it’s amazing. Definitely will buy this in the future!",2
"I saw no difference after using for a few weeks, the only difference I saw was how dry and flaky the skin under my eyes had become... not the change I was looking for.",0
I really love how this leaves my skin so soft and exfoliated.,2
"As a fair skinned girl living in Florida, SPF is a daily must. I was a little surprised at first at its color, but amazed when I put it on my skin. I feel like my skin is softer and less textured after using this product. I received it as a sample to test and review honestly. I’m not sure if I would splurge on this as a SPF item, but it did feel wonderful and protected my skin.",1
This is actually my first time using any kind of serum and I’d heard good things about the ordinary! My main concern was my skin had started having reactions to a moisturizer I tried and was extremely dry and flaky! I wanted a natural way to heal and moisturize the skin and decided to try this serum/oil in combo with another the ordinary product as well as night cream (I use these only at night) and it’s helped my skin heal and stay soft and moisturized! So nice!,2
"I am reviewing this oil based on what it does for my FACE, I have old cystic acne scars and every now and again, I have an eruption that can last weeks. I won’t go into how I’ve learned over the years to treat said eruptions, but this particular oil has helped tremendously as far as healing speed and scar prevention. If you exfoliate, this will be your best buddy. A few drops covers my whole face but I mainly use it to spot treat. When I remove those flakes and scabs post-treatment, this was the ONLY thing that soothed and healed and allowed me to apply makeup to cover my spot during the healing process. If you have eruptions like these, you probably have a little “arsenal“ ready. This is in it for me. I’ve tried it on my hair, infused it into my dry, damaged hair using my flat iron and yes, it worked miracles. But my fave way to enjoy it is using it for my face when it’s sick.",2
"I received this product to review from Influenster. It’s a nice way to remove your makeup at the end of the day, and melts on the skin. It also has a great scent. This product is a great alternative to a cleansing oil and is much less messy. I don’t know that I would repurchase this as it’s not typically something I use in my skin care routine, I like to keep it simple, but it’s a great choice for those who like to do a double cleanse!",1
I love to use this as a 20min mask before a night out,2
"Très pratique vu que c’est en bâton, mais ne fait ps grand chose (très léger). Pour le prix, ca ne vaut pas la peine.",0
This toner is everything and it even smells soooo amazing. My skin feels clean and refreshed when I first put this on and it absorbs nicely into the skin. This toner is slightly thicker than other ones I have tried so I recommend patting it into your skin with your fingers instead of using a cotton pad.  Not to mention that the design and shape of the bottle is absolutely stunning - it feels like a nice heavy glass and the bottle is so cute and aesthetic. Everything about this product seems very well thought out! Anyways totally obsessed with sweet smelling toner - it’s so unique!,2
"So far I’ve only been using this to supplement my other cleanser. I have heard good things and I’m definitely not disappointed. My skin feels smooth and clean after using this. Any little bumps on my nose are gone after I use this one, which I appreciate! Since I’m not using it daily I haven’t noticed anything like drying etc, but based on how nice my skin feels afterwards I can’t imagine it would be a problem. I can tell that there is no dirt or grime left behind, though I will say it doesn’t work efficiently as a make up removing cleanser. Of course, that’s fine as I don’t believe it claims to be. If you use a little extra is does fine but I’m not usually removing my makeup with it. Overall it seems relatively gentle but thorough for standard cleansing. I mostly use it in the morning. I think there is a decent amount of cleanser for the price of the 2 oz option. I’ll likely buy this again.",1
I loved this product so much I invested a small fortune in the KS entire line. It made my skin feel so smooth after and it smells wonderful. FYI the Vitamin serum has done wonders for my face.,2
"I REALLY want to like this cream because it SMELLS amazing! But I believe that aqua bomb gives me ACNE- which is my main skin issue so now I realized to stick to my simple aveeno.  I try to stay away from fragrance now, as well, even though I love the smell of this stuff.  I’ff have to use it on my feet and legs.",0
Love love love this eye treatment! So smooth. So hydrating. I could see a reduction in fine lines within a couple weeks! Will repurchase!,2
"I got this as a sample and although it made my skin feel baby smooth I couldn’t stand the smell. It smells like cold medicine, and for the price it should not smell bad. I also noticed when layering my other products on top it starting peeling.",0
Love the strawberry lip balm and used it frequently throughout the day. I accidentally got this one container wet and it rusted. Can’t open it now.,1
Glow recipe named this cream accurately. Plump plump cream is amazing. It makes my skin feel so hydrated and I’m obsessed with the glow I get. I love the products of glow recipe and this one is just another wonderful addition to my family. The packaging is cute and I love the texture of this cream as well. I highly recommend this,2
What can I say!! I’m in love with this product so much! Been using this serum for a couple of days now and my face have been smooth and glowing! I MUST say that I really recommend this product..,2
"Wowza!!! This is literally the best facial misfit user I have ever tried. Literally does it all. Brightens. Makes my skin glow. Smoothes, wrinkles disappear. Make the texture so gorgeous and literally perfect. In love.  Gifted by Fresh",2
This product is amazing. My skin looks and feels so much better,2
I wanted to like this so much but it was too greasy for me and it didn’t absorb into my skin at all.,0
"I love this moisturizer! It’s great for day time in the summer months. I have super oily skin in the summer and I like a really light moisturizer during the day that isn’t tacky feeling and this is perfect! I struggle with finding moisturizers that don’t feel super tacky on my skin or that are way too heavy for the day time.  If you’re wanting something that will be super hydrating or that you can use as a night cream this definitely isn’t what you’re looking for, this feels like water when rubbing on your skin and soaks in pretty quickly. It does have fragrance if that’s something you’re concerned with or sensitive to, it’s not a strong fragrance though. The price is a tad steep in my opinion for how much you get. Overall I love this moisturizer for Summer days.",2
"I have tried a bunch of primers at this point because I have hormonal acne, redness and uneven texture and I want my foundation to look as smooth as possible. This is definitely the best one I’ve tried so far!! The citrus smell is strong like a hand wipe but I’ve gotten used to it. It goes on easily, feels good, doesn’t break me out, helps my cheeks not dry out from my makeup, makes my foundation look smoother and last longer. Sooo really everything I’m looking for in a primer. :) This + Laura Mercier setting powder together are the magic combo for me",2
Hate the feeling I get from this in my skin. Feels like applying Vaseline straight to the face. No thanks.,0
"My FAVORITE! Ride or die, on my 3rd bottle! It lasts forever, not too steep of a price, doesn’t burn my eyes unless I get too much makeup in my eye when washing.  It cleans my face so well without drying my skin out which is EVERYTHING I look for in a cleanser.",2
I recently purchased this because of all the reviews and I can honestly say I glad I did. I use it everyday my lips are always dry and this has seriously kept my lips so hydrated. The best lip balm I have tried so far. Definitely going to repurchase this once I run out,2
This had been sitting in my cart for a few weeks and I am so glad I finally bought it. It literally glides on my skin. I have combination acne-prone skin and this feels silky smooth. It works great as a primer. I really only need a tiny bit to cover my whole face. Love it!,2
I would return it if I could but I waited too long to try it. It gives my acne. It’s too bad because I wanted to love it.,0
"I have suffered from redness on my face since turning 30, and in the journey of trying to find a product that actually work I spent hundreds, if not thousands of dollars trying products out to help cure it. This product has completely cured my red, and dry skin! It was the perfect consistency to hydrate, without it feeling heavy, and it gives me a beautiful glow. I also purchased the coordinating Cicapair serum, and together my skin has never looked better!",2
"It’s really not greasy at all and it smells amazing, just wished it moisturized a little better/deeper. Perfect for the summer though!",1
This is an amazing product that truly works wonders! Such a good brightening product.,2
"I received my free sample from Influenster and it is a Excellent product!  I recommend it 100% and it works perfectly, it is also hypoallergenic.  I love it.",2
"I loved it from day 1 , I used this for my skin before bed each night and noticed a large difference in my overall complexion. It brightened my skin tone, as well as adding moisture to my skin. My skin looks healthier, smoother. It appeared to provide a very calming and clarifying treatment.The lavender scent its just amazing.",2
"I stay at home everyday with my baby and in this heat, I have the AC on blast so my house is cool all the time and it makes my skin dry like the desert. I was using a heavy cream that I usually use in the winter but it didn’t help at all. I just started using this one and it is amazing! It doesn’t clog my pores at all and my skin is hydrated and glowing all day! I can’t recommend this enough! No more dry skin and dry patches around my nose! I don’t even need to use my hydrating mist anymore. Truly a wonderful product.",2
"I’m 42 years old and after using this product along with my regular night time skin care routine I have noticed that my spots are lighter, my face seems smoother.",2
I was so excited that Dermalogica gifted me this amazing biolumin c serum.  It is fantastic.   Its lightweight and absorbs quickly and completely.   I have been using this now a few weeks along with bituminous moisturizer.   Wow my skin is so amazing.  At 43 my face looks 33.  Thanks Dermalogica.,2
"Super nice moisturizer! I’ve definitely seen a noticeable difference in redness on my face after using this for a few days. It’s lightened up a bit! It feels really nice going on the skin, not too watery or thick but a good balance in-between. I will say, though, I have to use a somewhat large amount to feel like I’ve covered my entire face... that’s really the only downside.",2
"My friends all raved about Good Genes and after trying it myself, I am really impressed with its performance. I only use half a pump and that’s plenty of product to cover my entire face and neck, so I can see this bottle lasting me some time. The milky serum has a light lemongrass scent and tingles a smidge upon application, but isn’t uncomfortable or painful. It doesn’t magically clear up my hormonal breakouts overnight, but I do wake up in the morning with a noticeably brighter and tighter complexion. After about three applications, I can see even more improvements in my texture. So far, I’m very happy with the results. Gifted by Sunday Riley, but opinions are my own.",2
caused a huge breakout for me,0
"Good price for a good humectant solution. Does it job on maintaining the skin feel moist underneath my spf in the morning. Right after washing the face (not wiping it out), I swab my face with a cotton + toner, and while the skin is still moist, immediately use this. Followed by vitamin c HA suspension, then seal everything with mineral sunscreen. Doing a good job so far during the dry cold months.",2
"I wanted to love this. I don’t like wearing heavy foundation. This seems like a nice alternative. It contains sunscreen and has light coverage. The problem is that the product is really drying and caused my skin to get flakey and peel. It also settles into every line. I am really fair, but at the end of the day my skin had a slight greyish cast to it.",0
Tiktok made me buy it but the way it works made me keep it! This product is phenomenal. Leaves my skin looking brighter and feeling softer! It did leave my skin a little more sensitive so I suggest sticking to the recommended one to two time usage per week,2
My face likes to break out and this stuff keeps my face so calm it’s wonderful,2
"I use this on my face, since I live in a dry climate that is more harsh in the winter months. FAB Ultra repair got rid of the flaky skin around my eyes and forehead I have been dealing with lately like no other product I have tried in years. I’ve used many expensive creams, also. I love FAB! I ordered the cleanser also. Between the Clairsonic and this cream, my makeup goes on flawless and skin looks more youthful.. Amazing stuff!",2
"not very pleased... I wanted to love this.  I heard very good things about the Tatcha products so I decided to go ahead and buy a whole kit and this face wash as well. I have highly sensitive skin and dry skin, I will breakout to almost anything, once I used this wash and it was helping with my acne and my sensitive skin...at first...a couple days later and my face completely broke out and my face was drier than ever. This wash especially does not help during season changes or winter season. The one thing I enjoyed about this was the tiny exfoliating beads. and that’s about it. If anyone knows anything other great washes pleaseeeeee let me know I have been on  the hunt for awhile now.",0
"After only 2 weeks I can notice a visible difference in my skin. I love this product, in fact, I am hooked on all the Caudalie products. I also use the day & night cream & the firming lip & eye serum. WONDERFUL !! I have tried many other brand products, but none compare to Caudalie. The spa products are also fabulous.",2
This is absolutely an amazing exfoliater and something I never knew was missing from my beauty arsenal! I don’t have anything else in my collection like it. I absolutely love that it’s powder form it make storage much easier and cleaner and I don’t have to worry about spilling it. Now let’s talk about how well it works! It is good for sensitive skin and it’s non irritating but it also is very powerful and my smim feels very clean and refreshing without being dry and aggregated . It’s a must buy! Watching the powder turn into bubby liquid just adding water is kinda fun and unique. Great product,2
Youth to the people is the only product that was able to keep my skin hydrated. I’ve always had sensitive dry skin and finding the right moisturizer was always struggle. I am extremely happy with this product and the results are better than I expected. Highly recommended!,2
"I wanted to love this. I have really dry, sensitive skin and thought this would be the perfect moisturizer. I would use it at night and wake up with flaky skin.",1
"I do not write reviews, but I HAD TO for this product!! I have suffered from acne my entire life - I’m 25 now. It started out as small pimples / whiteheads / blackheads when I was younger. This past year it has turned into large cystic acne which I have not been able to find any cure for. These are gigantic, painful bumps on my cheeks that do not pop and take months to go away, even without touching them and using 10% benzoyl peroxide cream nightly. I have visited numerous dermatologists and for years have tried several pills, creams, and cleaning tools that unfortunately do not work for my skin. THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT THAT HAS WORKED. After one of the worst breakouts I have had in a year, I randomly came across this while researching new treatment options. I bought it yesterday, applied it once and the cysts / pimples I have had for the past month are literally half the size and redness already. This is insane. The smell is terrible and I can see that it is probably drying but the lumps on my face are almost non-existent! I cannot recommend this enough. I’ve been so close to trying Accutane but haven’t yet as I know it is very harmful to your body. I am so incredibly happy I have found this. You seriously need to try it if you suffer from cystic acne. It is worth the price.",2
I love the sleeping mask and was needing a new daily lip balm. This smells amazing and is super hydrating and not sticky. Obsessed.,2
So far so good I haven’t used this product often like I should to see the results but it is easy to use and applicate on my face. I can see my face does feel refreshed when I use it after cleaning my face. I did received the product in my PLAY! By Sephora October box complimentary from Influenster.,2
It is so hydrating ! Makes me skin feel refreshed. I have a dry / combo skin.,2
"I may have actually found the Holy Grail for my face!  I have NEVER found a moisturizer that fully worked for my combination skin! especially for the dry areas!  What’s so great that it’s light on the skin, you don’t even feel it! And I’m sure it’ll last super long, I’m still grazing the top! Worth the buy and might be my lifetime choice!",2
"I received this product is complimentary from Sunday Riley. After a few days of use, I really love it! It is the best vitamin C-infused facial product that I’ve ever used. It smells like sweet orange and looks like a light-textured lotion. My skin absorbed it easily and brightened it.",2
"I have found my favorite face cleanser! I love Josie Maran products and was very excited to try a sample of this. After I did I bought the big bottle. My face is oily is some areas and very dry in others, especially in the Winter. This leaves your skin smooth and moisturized even after you wash it off. When you first apply it is slightly sticking but once you add water its very smooth. The smell is very pleasant. I noticed someone say it smells a bit like grapefruit, I would agree but it is a bit sweeter.",2
"This cream didn’t do much for me. I didn’t want to spend $60 on an eye cream but ended up wasting $10. I won’t buy this again. Didn’t really moisturize, help with lines, or dark circles. Could have just put my face cream on my eyes.",0
excellent product very similar to the hydrating B5 Gel from Skin Ceuticals the consistency is like a thicker gel.,2
This exfoliating goop is pretty good and I felt like over time my skins texture was getting better especially around the nose area. The price is high so I don’t know if I will buy this again.,1
"I bought this because I have very dark circles on the inner corner of my eyes and they get puffy when I have not had enough water. I found it sticky around my eyes and it didn’t hydrate them well enough, though I don’t think that’s the point. My concealer appeared cracky on top of it. I know that caffeine is a really good anti inflammatory ingredient, so I’ve been using this as a spot treatment and my pimples flatten overnight. I’m going to use up the bottle but won’t repurchase.",1
"I received this product free of charge for testing purposes by Influenster. I love the brand Tatcha to begin with, I use two of their other products I was excited to add this to my regime. I love the instant effects and it’s idea of being silky but not heavy and oily. This gives me instant Brightening and makes me look more awake. The scent is amazing also. Can’t wait to see when I use this for a few months !",2
"This Shiseido Oil-Free Sunscreen is a liquid SPF that protects and is easy to use. The sunscreen is a light beige nude tinted and blends well into the skin. I didn’t experience any white cast or harsh coloring. This does contain fragrance but it was pleasantly light and the scent disappeared after on the skin. I appreciate that it has an SPF 42 because it means more protection from the sun. The downside of the liquid sunscreen is that I am never really sure how much to apply. This seems to be a combination of chemical and physical sunscreens, which seems to take a bit of both and put it into one. I sometimes layer my chemical and physical sunscreens so it is nice that this does it for you. It feels nice on the skin and easily absorbed. I wear SPF everyday and this will definitely be included in my rotation and routines throughout the year.",2
"I have a pretty red complexion (rosacea) which I usually cover with foundation, but this stuff works so well to cover and even out the redness that I now wear it instead of foundation for more casual outings, and practically all summer (so the SPF is perfect!).",2
Love this product! Made my skin feel amazing and definitely brightened my face! I am 41 years old and felt like this helped keep me looking bright eyed! I would recommend!,2
I have normal skin and it I not sensitive. This product left my skin feeling super smooth and glowing. I noticed that after I used it my moisturizer went on super smooth. When I used it it did sting but the product does say that it’s normal. I didn’t have a problem with the feeling however someone with sensitive skin might want to test a small patch before applying it all over.,2
"When I needed a new cleanser, I tried this based on the Sephora.com reviews. So glad I did! I love everything about it: the texture, how little I need to use, how it works with my Clarisonic, and, most importantly, how my skin looks and feels! I started with a free sample from my local Sephora & was back within 5 days to buy it. That was a month ago & I still love it. TRY IT!!",2
Ok moisturizer. I’ve been using this consistently for 5 months and have noticed a difference in fine lines. hydrates ok. Overpriced,0
"I tested this product for the last 2 weeks so that I can witness all the effects that it produces, positives and negatives. I personally don’t have major dark spots but I do have a variation in my skin tone, which means some places on my face are lighter than others. After trying this toner, I only noticed that my skin got softer and brighter (I went for a passport picture and the lady cancelled my picture because my forehead was so bright, and I don’t have an oily skin for it to reflect the light at this intensity). I would say that the moisturizer used after the application of this product makes a great change as well. However, my skin tone is still as messed up as before so if you have this issue, this product is not for that. Also, the fragrance is too strong, and is not convenient for people with sensitive skin. Overall, this product definitely makes the skin softer and brighter, but does not really solve the problem with pigmentation.",1
Product was good but the tube burst open from the back the first time I tried to use it.,1
"If you’re struggling with acne, this is a MUST try. I struggled with acne all throughout my teen years and then as I went into my late teens to early 20s it slowly went away. However, I turned 24 and my acne came back at full force. I was trying every product under the sun to get rid of my hormonal/cystic acne that was destroying my face and nothing was making a difference. Finally I tried out this product after watching a YouTuber blog about this product and how it changed her face. THIS IS A GAME CHANGER. Around the same time I found this product I was also put on medicine from the doctor (which definitely played a roll in my face clearing) but without this product I don’t think I would have seen the same results. On nights when I don’t use this oil I’ll see a change in my skin and the next morning have a small break out starting to appear. But It has been a few months of consistency and my acne is for the most part completely cleared up and I’m now just dealing with scaring. I use this at night and in the morning along with Sunday Riley’s good genes lactic acid and I finally feel good enough about my skin again to go out into public without makeup on (only on my lazy days of course)! The price may be a little steep for both products but I will never go without either one again.",2
I like this product for its ingredients but the farmacy one still does a better job at removing makeup...this one just smears waterproof mascara around on my face and doesn’t actually lift it. I find myself using more of this product to actually get all of my makeup off than when I was using the farmacy one. I just wish the farmacy one had these ingredients!!,1
Smells delightful and feels so luxurious! I love this stuff. My skin stays clear and smooth.,2
I was gifted this product for free from the company but it’s honestly so great!! It has visibly decreased the “wrinkles” around my eyes and greatly helps with the puffiness! I would definitely recommend this!,2
Used it for a week and it caused a severe breakout across my face. Really sad since I’ve been hearing excellent reviews about it for months. Oh well...,0
"This product its amazing, make my skin feel so fresh and its not heavy at all. My skin improved since the first use. I love it!",2
As I man who has dealt with puffy baggy eyes I was to the point where I gave up hope for any realistic non makeup cover up!!! Until I tried this product I have been using the under eye magic and I am sold on the affects I have had compliments and i could not be happier to use this product..,2
I’m obsessed with this! Fresh always kills it when it comes to packaging. The container feels very heavy and luxurious. The cream is more of a gel cream consistency so it gives you the hydration of a cream but the lightweight feel of a gel. It melts right into the skin and leaves it so soft!! The only thing is it does have a slight rose scent so I would be aware of that. Other than that it’s left my skin so soft and nourished.,2
"Did I really need another face wash? No, but I really wanted to try this. I’m so glad I made the purchase! This face wash does not disappoint!  It has a soft smell that I love (I’m sensitive to smells) and is great on sensitive skin. I highly recommend trying this face wash!",2
"This stuff is amazing! It not only clears your skin and controls oiliness but also shrinks your pores dramatically. I’ve never used an AHA product that does any of this as well as this product. I would highly recommend to anyone with combination or oily skin, especially if you struggle with breakouts and enlarged pores.",2
I absolutely love this face mask! I think it’s my new favorite. I used to use their charcoal pore cleaner mask but after I tried this one I think it’s my go too. It leaves my face feeling fresh and my pores look smaller and my skin feels tight. It does burn a little bit on my cheeks when I first apply it but it goes away after I finish applying it to the rest of my face. Washing it off can be hard sometimes but I think it’s because I use a thick layer.,2
"I used this product on my face before I got a spray tan to get rid of any dead skin and it works really well! My skin felt very smooth and soft. It also smells really good. The exfoliating particles are really small, smaller than other exfoliants I’ve used, so it probably gets rid of more dead skin. However, it probably is not worth the price. Other exfoliants will do the job for much cheaper, even if slightly less quality.",1
Absolute favourite makeup remover. Having a hard time trying anything else because this is so luxurious. Literally melts your makeup away and leaves your skin feeing light and refreshed,2
Love this mask! My skin looked so glowy & felt so smooth the next morning!,2
This is my absolute FAVORITE product! Hyaluronic acid has done wonders on my skin. I use it in both my morning and night routine and the way that it hydrates my skin and locks in that moisture is unbelievable.,2
"It’s a great product to use when your skin can use a pick-me-up! I like to use this when my skin has been feeling dry and irritated. It hydrated my skin and brings it back to life. I usually apply after cleansing and toning. I let it soak into my skin for 20 minutes. I don’t wash it off. I just apply an oil or serum on top of it and my skin feels like butter! I do think there’s some room for improvement in terms a making it a tad more moisturizing, but overall I enjoy the mask.",1
This is the best face wash ever!! It cleared up my face but also leaves me with soft moisturized skin . This is a must have !!,2
"Love using this product as a makeup remover! Leaves your skin feeling great, takes a bit longer to remove waterproof Makeup though",1
I use this stuff as an eye primer and a cuticle cream not so much as a lip balm. This stuff is amazing it has many uses other than putting on the lips. It’s a salve. It’s good stuff,1
Love the smell and the results. It is very gentle and won’t leave your sling red and irritated like some exfoliators can do. I highly recommend this if you are barely dipping your toes in exfoliation. Do not start off with The Ordinary red mask one just yet. This is a good start so that you don’t irritate or burn your skin. Also the smell is heavenly which is an added bonus to a very good product.,2
literally nothing has broke me out worse in my entire life,0
"I’ve used many Clinique products and I thinkthis is the best one so far. I used a smallamount twice daily after toner. Smart ClinicalRepair had very minimal fragrance and a thin,yet lush half cream-half gel consistency thatsmoothed easily over my face. My skinrapidly drank up this light, refreshing serum.It left my face deeply hydrated with anamazing non-greasy glow, was a greataddition to my other skincare products andwore well under my buildable foundation. Thesample only had enough for 5 days but I dobelieve my skin looked better, felt amazingand my fine lines were slightly diminished. Ican only imagine how great it would be afterlong term use!I received this product complements of Topbox Circle in exchange for my honest review. #freeproduct",2
I have mixed feelings about this toner. I felt as though it made my skin very sensitive to the sun and it gave my skin a slightly sticky feel after applying it. Although it does qualify as a “Clean at Sephora” product I didn’t like the strong alcoholic like scent or the burning/tingling sensation that would happen after I applied the toner. The only positive is the toner did give my skin a radiant glow. I have combination skin so this toner may work better for other skin types.,0
With my combo skin it’s so hard to find a cream that moisturizes without clogging my pores and causing me to break out. This cream has finally been my solution! A little bit goes a long way so it’s definitely worth the price!,2
"This cleanser is not great. I do feel like it cleanses my skin well, but it also leaves it feeling stripped dry. After a few uses my skin started to feel a little grainy. Wouldn’t recommend for dry, sensitive skin.",0
I absolutely love this scrub! It leaves my skin so soft and radiant. Unlike most scrubs that burn and cause my skin to breakout this one does my skin wonders!  I will continue to use this wonderful scrub as part of my skin care routine!!,1
"I used to get 2-3 big cysts every month when hormones spiked. Used this for over six months, have seen a couple red spots in that time, and no proper cysts. Used too much at first, didn’t believe that it really only does take a small drop to cover face and neck. Not drying, because you use your own moisturizer over it.",2
I’ve steadily used this product and can’t figure out what this is supposed to be doing to my skin because nothing has changed. I don’t see any difference in the look or texture of my skin. So glad I bought the small jar!,0
"Worst product ever. The price is reasonable and the amount of product is great, but this whole collection of products do not work at all. Makes the skin feel very dry. I spoke to several people who used it and all of those believe the same about this. Not worth it..",0
I had seen this product awhile ago and had been wanting to get it and well now I finally bought it and I love it! It is the prfect spritzer for on the go or even just relaxing. You can spray it on with or without makeup. It is a great refresher. I have to hide the next cans from my little one because he just loves to spray it all over his face and hair :) Definitely a product that I will be purchasing from now on. It is a great little mister for those hot days or if you just want some extra hydration!,2
"This moisturizer feels very thick and luxurious. A little goes a long way and leaves your skin with a nice, healthy glow!",2
"Did absolutely nothing for me. I put these on a few blemishes 3 nights in a row to see how fast they healed in comparison to others, and the ones without the dots cleared up faster.",0
This is the only face cream that has managed to help fine lines around my eyes. I’ve been looking for ten years and I can’t even remember all the different moisturizers I’ve tried. plus it’s cruelty-free! love it!,2
Nice feeling on skin. Glowy when on the skin. I don’t see lasting results. Not greasy and easy to apply,1
"This stuff makes me so happy. I use once a week-ish, for 10 minutes, followed by a lot of moisture. Make sure you’ve REALLY washed it off, takes me a few minutes. I run a damp cotton round over my skin after to get off any remaining residue. My skin glows and it has helped my skin with hyperpigmentation, acne, fine lines, you name it. Highly recommend - and cannot beat the price at less than 10 bucks. This bottle lasts me quite a while with only a few drops used weekly. Don’t forget to wear SPF during the day when using products like this!",2
"My usual balm was discontinued, grabbed this to try. It’s like no other balm I’ve used and I’m not sure it fits the description. it’s slightly waxy and doesn’t emulsify well. Because it doesn’t emulsify, it’s hard to work with, you have to manhandle your skin much more than I’m used to, especially with waterproof eye makeup. it also doesn’t rinse cleanly. My tube separates constantly, and it’s really hard to recombine. In general you shouldn’t have to work this hard to make a product do its job. I’m glad this was budget friendly. I’ll be looking for another option. 2 stars for price and relatively simple ingredients.",0
"I love the smell, texture, and moisture of this product. This has become a staple in my skincare routine and days that I don’t use it I miss it! It’s key to only use a small amount on your face or it can feel really heavy and sticky.",2
This a real review (not an influencer)!!! I have been using this product for 3 weeks with ZERO results. I was using this product to reduce dark spots and to date it has only made me breakout more. I have been using this toner with the C-Rush™ Brightening Gel Crème. I will go back to using witch hazel and my vitamin face cream and just deal with the marks.,0
It lasts long on the lips and is very moisturizing best long lasting LIPBALM ever,2
"I like this product because it feels light and foamy and is unscented. I haven’t used it long enough to figure out if it’s actually helping to reduce blackheads, but I like it and will continue using it.  It definitely doesn’t have any adverse effects on my skin, and I like that it’s a “clean“ product.",1
"I am loving this cream. It is thick and luxurious, like some of my other creams that I paid double for. It leaves my skin feeling super moisturized and plump. I absolutely love it and wear it daily.",2
I really liked the added moisture to sun protection And the lightness of it. I typically break out after using sunscreens but i haven’t so far with this one. I didn’t receive this product to test but the above is my true opinion on the product.,1
I was hesitant to buy this as I have very sensitive skin... but I am sooooooo happy that I did. I have only been using these for about a week now and my skin looks incredible. My breakouts have significantly improved... my pores definitely look smaller and some of the wrinkles seem to be smoothing out. I will definitely buy this again :),2
Not for sensitive skin. Nice product but made me breakout.,1
"If I could only use 1 product for the rest of my life it would be this. Got lazy with my skin routine, broke out like never before and almost got to the point of buying acne medication. Used this two nights in a row and my face is glowy and clear again. Note: when this product is fresh, it does leave my skin red afterward, but after a while it tones down, but without losing efficacy. The packaging is superb at preserving it!",2
"I love the scent (mild honey smell) and the cushiony feel of this moisturizer, but I am on the fence on whether or not to repurchase. It’s quite expensive and I’m not sure if it clogged my pores. I will probably buy it again at some point and patch test very thoroughly and slowly. It’s lovely to use but for those who have skin prone to clogs, be wary!",1
"I have wrinkles and crinkles and definitely in need of help! I have used several bottles of the Clarins Restorative Eye cream,mostly because I like the “temple to temple“ all purpose concept of eye products (brighten, help with dark circles, de-puff, lift.) But I just couldn’t justify the price. I have used one bottle of the All About Eyes and am buying my second. I find it is never irritating, stays put all day, is “temple to temple use“ and really does the trick. The Clarins is good too, but no better -- and is nearly triple the cost. So I will stick with the Clinique.",2
"I loved this product! The scent is great, I am usually bothered by the scent of sunscreens but not these. It was very blendable and did not leave a white cast once you put in the work to rub it in. I love that it is non comedogenic as I do have problems with breakouts on my face, especially from sunscreen. I felt protected and my skin felt moisturized. I like to wear this when I go out for walks in the sun, and when I work up a sweat I felt the sweat roll right off. I wish it lasted a little longer which is my one reason for taking off a star.",2
GAME CHANGER!! 110% recommend,1
This product is so smooth and smells so good but has made every sunscreen I have peel. Maybe save it for an inside only day?,1
wow! the brightening power in this cleaner has helped my ance scars lighten even though it’s not an acne cleanser. my pores are noticeably smaller and my skin feels cleaner without over drying. will be looking into more products from tatcha!,2
"I would have never believed I could use this creamy oil for moisturizing under my eyes but I do! As soon as I cleanse my face I press a small amount under my eyes and let it soak in while I moisterize my face. Then I apply my makeup! My eye area stays moist and my consealer doesn’t cake. I use it on my lips, elbows, knees and feet or anyplace else that needs a little more attention!",2
nice. very hydrating probably best for normal to combo skin. I think dry skin would need more hydration,1
"I honestly can’t believe how well this scrub worked. I received it as a free sample and was pretty skeptical. I applied the scrub to a freshly washed, dry face and could not believe how much dead skin was removed. My face was so smooth. The only reason I wouldn’t give it 5 stars is because of the dry feeling my skin felt after use. I would recommend pairing it with a really good facial moisturizer.",1
"Love this! Tested this out during a full day outside and didn’t disappoint. It has a light, creamy gel texture and the scent smells very fresh. I personally loved the scent and didn’t find it to be too strong or overwhelming. To me, it smelled very clean with hints of light floral and citrus.It applies like a dream! Such a soft and smooth texture, no chalkiness and leaves behind a nice dewy finish immediately after application. After a few minutes, it absorbs fully and leaves no shine or stickiness. But skin feels more hydrated and soft! If you have incredibly dry skin, you might need to use with an additional moisturizer but since I have oily/combo skin, it was perfect for me. After 6 hours in the sun (with a mid-day touch up) I did not get burned and my skin still felt nice after I showered. Sometimes, my skin can feel irritated after being in the heat and wind for that long but didn’t experience any of that. Will continue to use and really happy with it so far :)",2
"I would give it more stars if that was even possible!I never write reviews, but this product deserves it! I changed my skin texture completely and it is super gentle at the same time! Worth every penny.",2
So I chose This product from Sephora as my Birthday gift and I have to admit this moisturizer is a very nice one. It smells pretty and doesn’t linger long. Feels great on the face and sinks in fairly quickly. I have noticed in just 3 days a luminosity to my skin. I would have to say this is definitely the reason why. I absolutely LOVE it and will continue to buy it.,2
"I have Lupus so sunscreen is an important part of my daily routine. I love this particular sunscreen because it doesn’t smell, it’s sheer as described and is lightweight. I’ve had no problems wearing this over my usual skin care routine, however I don’t know how it would hold up over makeup. That’s why I buy foundation with SPF.",2
"This product works well, so for that it has more than 1 star.  The taste is sickeningly sweet and scent so potent it seems to invade the air.  My husband asked what the heck he was smelling.  With so many other good lip treatment and conditioning options, do yourself a favor and bypass this.",0
"The best toner I’ve tried this year, the smell is like the fruit and and texture is amazing, my favorite so far.",2
"I really enjoy using this mask, not only for a hydrating sleeping situation but also just as a deep overnight moisturizer. The texture is nice and love that its nice and thick. Glad its back - right in time for travel!",2
"Textures great, but wish i got it in one of the other colours. Poppy isn’t really dark skin friendly",1
Love this product. It’s very gentle and it did not dry my face out. It also removed all my makeup. I bought the small one to try but will be repurchasing the larger size.,2
I have dry dehydrated aging skin with rosacea. I have been struggling to find a routine that helped with my problems without making the redness an irritation worse. Within the first couple of weeks of using this my skin started to become better hydrated with less redness and a plumper appearance. I don’t love the price but I have not tried very many products that are this effective. If you have similar issues this may be worth a try.,2
"These are definitely pricey for what you’re getting, but after using three of them over time I’ve definitely seen clearer pores and blackheads being removed. Not the greatest thing that I had to use three, but at least I saw it happen.",1
"This stuff smells like a chemical cleaner, similar to the stuff you’d use to clean your toilet or bathroom sink. It’s really hard to look past the smell.",0
I love this cream. I myself has enlarged pores on my face near my nose. The cream is light weight and smells amazing. After using the product for a week I notice the my pores were blurred and not noticeable when using the product. Will continue to use.I recieved this product free from influenster for testing purposes,2
highly recommend this after I have been using it twice a day for three weeks. My dullness and acne scaring has definitely improved! Would repurchase for sure!,2
I havevery dry skin and this cleanser is gentle enough for me. I do ot feel drier or tight after using it. This is a great product that leaves your skin feeling fresh !,2
I’m on my second bottle.  I received my first bottle as a gift.  I have very dry skin.  My skin has totally transformed since since this product.  I use it in the morning and night. My skin is glowing.  If you have dry skin.  Try it.  You won’t be disappointed!,2
"This is a very effective makeup remover. It removes every bit of makeup on the face. After washing my face though, my skin feels dry and hurts. It feels like the product has stripped the natural oils from my face and left it dry and dehydrated. I still do recommend it because most makeup cleansers are very harsh on sensitive skin and this is nonirritating and gentle on skin.",1
"The bottle leaked in my bathroom, And It doesn’t clean that good.",1
"Oddly enough, I hadn’t used many Origins products until I received it complimentary in my Influenster Voxbox. I was pleasantly surprised. The texture: amazing! The smell: amazing! The results: amazing! I’m a fan and repeat customer now.",2
"I received this free for testing purposes. I like this! It’s different than just about any other product I’ve used in that I can see an immediate difference in my skin. I don’t know which ingredient causes the instant glow, but it’s visible. I can’t say whether it is significantly better than other similar products beyond that, but it is nice, and if you like Estee products you’ll probably find this to be enjoyable. The scent is nice, light and floral, it’s a good texture and a little goes a long way.",1
"This might be the only chemical peel available at Sephora. I normally use K-beauty brand chemical peels, but I ran out of product and needed a replacement ASAP. The quality of the product is quite good. It’s made in S. Korea and it had the same sanitary packaging that’s found on Asian skin products. The mini size is perfect for travel especially since chemical peels can degrade with time and exposure. It’s nice to have one that can be kept in its original bottle. My only warning is that this chemical peel is strong, much stronger than the ones you find on the Asian market. I don’t recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin. It’s also expensive. $20+ for 3oz of product is very steep. If you’re in a pinch, this is a good temporary substitute. There’s no way I could recommend the full product at full price.",1
"This was like a thick paste when I first got it, and really hard to squeeze out. After about a month, it was easier to get out of the tube but it began to separate. So I would get a paste-like balm and liquid. It was incredibly messy and left my face with a greasy film. It also struggled to break down complex eye looks; like anything with liners and mascara.",0
Felt so good on my skin! Very moisturized afterwards.,2
I use nightly as a moisturizer. I have very bad dermatitis in the cold seasons and my skin would get all dry and read and irritated. I can feel my skin calming as I put this on. Yes it is definitely expensive at $48 but it is definitely worth it.,2
"I remember a few years ago Clinique had a campaign for their Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion which said it was a “drink for your skin“. The gel is no different in my opinion- when I apply it, I actually feel like it’s hydrating my face. I look forward to moisturizing because it’s so pleasant- crazy, I know!I use this gel lotion along with the Clinique Acne Solutions Line and think it’s a great program for clear skin. I wish Clinique was cheaper, but other than that, this product gets 5 stars!",2
"i bought this at one of the midtown stores during a makeup spree and since i was already buying two buckets of products I figure i’d treat myself to some nice salve for my kit. well it was melted and oozing out of the package, i could barely open the lid because of it. i’m definitely returning this lil camper as soon as i get the chance. lame.",0
I absolutely love dermalogica products for their efficacy and quality ingredients. This microfiant does a great job with keeping pores clear. I use it 2-3 times a week since I have sensitive skin and it works a charm.,2
"I wanted to wait a little before writting my review about this product, sometimes I get really happy and 2 weeks later my skin came back to what it was... I have the worst kind of skin; oily, large pores, blackheads, acne when I’m stress and sometimes pimples from blackheads. I tried a lot of products and nothing seems to work for a long time, until I found this dearest one. I use it morning and night, even for remove make-up on my face. I follow with a toner from Clinique “Acne Solution“ and the “oil control“ from Murad. I used to swear by the same brand for the three steps, but I realize over the years that it doesn’t really change a thing. It’s been my best match since I can remember and right now I have a really clean skin (during the day my face doesn’t get oily neither) This cleanser came from Heaven! I just don’t recommend this product for those who have dry skin, it will only make it worst. Don’t forget to use a moisturiser after!!",2
"This product was great on skin tags and blemishes on my neck but I didn’t notice much difference on my face, I only had a 3 day sample. Although it was a bit strong for my skin, I plan to purchase it and use every other day to see if I notice more improvements.",1
It’s amazing! My lips felt so hidrating and soft the next morning,2
"I got this in the summer sun block kit that just came out. I loved this stuff so much I returned the D.E D bronzi drops I hated and bought this instead. I use this on days I don’t want to wear makeup and it makes my skin look tone even and like I’m wearing foundation! It’s so nice to have a product that protects my skin and makes it look so great so that I don’t always have to wear make up. The picture I attached is with just clean skin and this product (after moisturizer). It stayed intact like this through breakfast out at a restaurant, grocery shopping, a mall trip and then yard work. When I cleanse my face later at night it is always still less red than it is on days I don’t use this and I apply makeup instead. My complexion is also more even. FYI I had just had a microdermabrasion treatment the night before this pic and no redness the next day because of this product!!!",2
"This stuff is great. I’ve been using it for about a week. I received a sample from influenster. It makes my skin feel so smooth. The consistency was a bit to get used too - is it a serum? A moisturizer? Regardless, it fits into my routine perfectly. I like to use it after a serum and before a thicker moisturizer. The scent is AMAZING. I LOVE putting it on just for the smell alone. A little bit goes a long way too.",1
"Okay...it is really expensive. I bought this on an emotional buy, without thinking about the price. I’m so glad it works well for me.I do weekly mandelic acid peels for acne hyperpigmentation. The peel works well, but my skin is usually red and stinging immediately after. I use this mask for 30 minutes, and within seconds my skin calms down and doesn’t burn anymore. I think that could be due to the aloe and cucumber extract in the mask. It hydrates fine (I do need to use moisturizer following, but I have dry skin).I also have picky skin that breaks out easily, but I’ve never had a problem with this. I love this mask for anytime my skin is irritated. It calms it right up. I’ve had mine for 9 months and may soon need to replace. I will definitely continue to use this as a splurge product!",2
This mask is great for oily skin. It kinda hydrates and kinda tone the skin but not thing like big difference. It leaves my skin smooth and kinda pore minimized. Not thing much but just right.,2
Really works most chap sticks Intially feel good. But Actual dry out your lips.and you are constantly putting on.This one WORKS twice a day a lips are grear,2
Love this moisturizer! I have combo skin and it is hard to find a moisturizer that will hydrate but won’t make me super greasy either. I noticed the wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes looking better too.  I only gave it 4 stars because all the black lettering on the container came off when I would use it and I would end up with little specks of black on my face.,1
"Pros: nice container, comes with a spatula, nice texture, smells decent - fruity and kind of like a cocktail.Cons: seems to leave a film on my face, which isn’t a huge deal because it comes off during my second cleanse, but I really don’t like it.I wouldn’t NOT recommend it, but I think there are better options. The scent is a little to heavy for me and it really bothers me that it doesn’t seem to come off very well until I do my second cleanse.I will finish this jar but probably won’t repurchase. I still really like this brand overall.",1
"I’ve been using this cleanser for a few months now. At first, it dried my skin out, so I backed off using it to a couple times a week to give my skin time to adjust. Now, I use it day and night and my skin is no longer dry! My skin appears brighter and those hormonal acne flare ups are a thing of the past. A bottle will last a long time. I’m about a quarter of the way through mine.",2
I was pleasantly surprised by the texture of this product. I expected a creme or thin liquid. This cleanser has the consistency of gel. It has no acidic smell and is very gentle on the skin. I just started using this product so cannot honestly give helpful feedback regarding blemishes or pores. I can honestly say that my face and neck feel very smooth since using the product.,1
This is a really great mask! It hydrates really well and is great during the winter months. I use it 2-3 times weekly and my skin feels great when I wake up.,2
I really like this product. It makes your face feel super soft after application! It’s a thicker feel which i like!  A little goes a long ways. I would definitely recommend this product!,1
"Such a great, affordable option. It isn’t obviously as amazing as your clinical or medical grade products but IS AN AMAZING OPTION!!! Not everyone can afford pure, high end products and I recommend this even if you can afford the higher end items.I wish the dropper was significantly better though... drips all over the place even when you aren’t squeezing it, really hard not to make a bit of a mess or to control the amount of drops quite well at all... with the higher end HA I have, it’s a very clear *drop, drop* and this runs and runs... Would repurchase!",1
This product worked beautifully with my skin. I saw a difference in just one day. It was very light weight and felt so nice and refreshing on my skin. Tactcha makes top of the line products and this is just another to add the the collection.,2
Every other moisturizer I have used has made my face break out. This one is great because it is lightweight and leaves me face silky without the grease of lotions.,2
"I know it’s not your skin coming off but somehow when I use this, my skin looks so fresh in the morning. I want to hate on this because it fools people into thinking it’s sloughing off your skin, which it’s not. But gosh darn it, it definitely does something good to my skin",1
"I was afraid of using this in fears that it would clog my pors with its oily consistency. It’s the other way around!! It’s so effective at removing absolutely all of my foundation and makeup before washing my face. In fact, I’ve seen incredibly great results since I started using it - with no break outs!!!",2
"This oil is really good and can be used for skin, nails, hair, where ever! Pricey but a little goes a long way.",1
"This product is worth every penny. I initially received both items as samples in a skincare box. It wasn’t until my samples ran out and I stopped using it that I realized what a difference it had been making on my skin. When I stopped using it, I noticed that my skin went back to being a little dull and splotchy. Once I bought the full size to start using again, my skin regained a nice glow. Note - You’ll get the best results by following the directions closely. You need to use 3-4 drops of the oil (a little goes a LONG way), let that absorb for 10 minutes, then follow with the lactic acid. I use this twice a week and have no problems with it, despite having pretty sensitive skin.",2
Got this a month or so back in my Sephora play box and I absolutely love it. I have oily skin and this is a the only moisturizer that hydrated my skin after using drying acne products without making me oilier or break out. It’s good stuff!,2
"Finally a facial scrub that’s not harsh and still makes your skin feel cleaner! My husband is very particular about the feel of a cleanser. He used And and now claims it’s his. I really enjoy this scrub in the mornings, k feel it leaves my skin feeling fresh and ready to kickstart the day!",2
I enjoyed using this Aqua Bomb Cleansing Balm! This product left my face feeling smooth after use! Would recommend!,2
"I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. I tried this for the first time today, and it has a very unpleasant scent, kind of like traditional sunscreen but with something more pungent added. it’s a very thick formula so it felt like it sat on top of my skin. I think it would be great if you plan to be in a high-sun environment, but not good for every day wear.",1
Really enjoyed this light skin cream. It made my skin look less shiny and oily. I really recommend it.,2
This product goes on really smoothly and feels refreshing. A little bit goes a long way,1
"If I could give this more stars I would. I have tried so many different products, way more expensive products that did not work. this is an excellent exfoliator if you have milia. My skin is fairly sensitive and dry. This actually exfoliates and is not too harsh. Love it.",2
Great for a sample product - I liked the texture and the scent.  Would need to purchase larger bottle for maximum effectiveness.,1
The Goop Glow mask is perfect for pore tightening and all over skin tightening! I do have to put a big caution sign on this due to the acid it is quite aggressive on sensitive skin but if used as instructed it’s perfectly fine! There is a tingling sensation when the mask is applied.,1
"I’ve had blackheads my whole life and I almost cleared them in a day with this face mask and The Ordinary Salicylic acid 2% face mask! This can be a little agressive, my skin was really red after I put it on so I wouldn’t recommend it if you have sensitive skin but after letting it on overnight my skin was GLOWING!!!!",2
"This is a great mask, really leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry. Definitely glad I added it to my skin care routine.",1
Tried a sample and loved it. Worth the price.,2
"I’m not trying to be dramatic, but this is the product I’ve been looking for FOREVER!  My face has always been shiny, no matter what primers or makeup I’ve used.   Even though I’m 41, I’m still prone to breakouts",2
"This is the best moisturizer I’ve tried hands down! Try it, you won’t regret it. I’ve gone through about 6 bottles of this I love it so much I refuse to try any other. Before this moisturizers I tried 4 other higher end ones and nothing was as good as this. Definitively recommend!!",2
it feels greasy and so heavy that you’ll feel it all day. gave me a lot of texture that I still couldn’t get rid of,0
Love this stuff! It has helped clear up my acne and just overall helped my skin,2
"Pricey but a little goes a long way. I take off one star because the pump packaging makes the product completely unrecyclable and I am trying to cut back on plastic waste. For the price point, I know DE can afford better, sustainable packaging. It hydrated and moisturized my eyes well and never pilled or caused irritation. It helped a bit with my dark circles but it did take a while in comparison to my other eye products that contain caffeine in them. I didn’t notice any difference in my fine lines. I probably won’t be repurchasing since it’s a high price point and didn’t hit all the marks that it claimed.",1
I like to use this product at night before I go to bed since it’s pretty thick. The scent is very pleasant and it seems to work pretty well. You definitely need to apply thick layer to really get the benefits of it.,2
"I love this stuff already! It’s thick so a little goes a long ways, and my skin was automatically 10x more moisturized and soft! No scent so it’s great for sensitive skin as well! I love that it was thick but didn’t leave my skin feeling oily or clogged like some other products do! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes but i will definitely be adding this to my daily routine!",2
"DISCLAIMER: I LOVE THIS OIL.However, my skin is very sensitive to this product :( I loved mixing it with my drunk elephant anti-pollution d-bronzi bronzing serum to create an effortless no makeup makeup look. Unfortunately, every time I use this product, I end up with major breakouts along my chin & a little on my cheeks. I wish I could love this oil in its entirety but I cannot. I have to opt for soothing oils that are especially good around my beard area.",0
"I wanted to like these so bad but they didn’t do anything for me. I have combination skin and other than drying my skin out a little, nothing happened. I gave it 2 stars because it didn’t harm my skin but it didn’t do anything good either.",0
"Using this by itself of layering it always causes my face to be an oil slick mess in less than 1hr. I’ve tried using it @night vs using it during the day and I get the same results. Following the directions or applying it to dry skin, I’m still an oily mess in less than 1hr. Not just my T-zone either, but my entire face.",0
"I would say this is a decent cream for dry skin, but not the best (especially since it’s winter time). When I use this moisturizer by itself, my skin looks dewy, but I’ve noticed it’s still a bit flaky and probably only being moisturized at the surface level. When I use this in combination with the Fresh Seaberry Face Oil (10/10 would recommend), then the flakiness disappears and my skin feels more supple and well moisturized. This would definitely be a good moisturizer if you have normal or possibly combination skin.",1
Love this product! My skin is certainly more even after using. I got the sample size first and then purchased the full size. Definitely recommend! (I have to use extra moisturizer),1
"My skin has never looked better. After one use I could notice a huge difference. I recommend not getting it on your lips though, as it stung mine.",2
"I was definitely sold on its scent; it is Amaziing! besides the fact that it smells delicious, it is a perfect lightweight moisturizer.",1
"Eh. Not really a fan. I regularly have oily skin, super oily, when it’s not managed along with large pores and blackheads covering my t zone. They aren’t too noticeable except on my nose, but I notice them. I tried this twice. The first time a few weeks and didn’t really see a difference. The second time I gave it 5 weeks using it only in the AM because I was using retinol at night. I seen no results or difference in my face. I started using the Inkey List’s Salicylic Acid Cleanser for a week and seen better results (even though that is drying as well) the texture of my face is better and can noticeably see the surface of my skin slightly changing. I heard great things about Murad and bought a bunch of their products, but this is one I can definitely and will live without.",0
Cleans the perfect amount. Fragrance free as well! LOVE!!!,2
"The best!! Great price point, and DOES THE JOB. Melts all of my makeup, and a little bit goes a long way. I bought this in November and I’m still using it, 8 months later. I will never waste any more money on another “popular” make up removing balm. This is TIMELESS for me.",2
i Really Love This Product It Helps Me With My aDry Skin Especially Before I Put On Makeup.. My Makeup Use To Look All Cakey.. But Ever Since I Started Using This.. ai Seen The Difference..I Recieved The Product Completely Free By Influenster For An Honest Review..,2
"This is my FAVORITE makeup primer ever (even though its a sunscreen)! I have always struggled to keep my foundation in place, it seems to disappear after only an hour or 2. With this, my makeup actually stays on all day! I have purchased it several times and given it as a gift to my mom, we both love it. It has very similar consistency to Smashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer but with the added bonus of sunscreen. There is no white cast (although my skin is pretty light). This sunscreen somehow blurs your pores so I use it daily even when I don’t apply makeup. I haven’t burned when using it but if I’m going to the pool or beach I usually take more precautions, using several layers of different sunscreens on my face because I’m sensitive to burning. Side note: If you use this and experience pilling when you apply it, it is not compatible with whatever product you put on your face beforehand. I have one lotion that causes this - all others have been compatible.",2
". first of all, this smells amazing- it’s like a cactus watermelon mixed drink almost. so using it is definitely super fun, it also has a cool consistency. it helps for me to use this 2x a week to exfoliate - makes the skin smoooooth!",2
"One of the very few products I’ve bought twice! For my sensitive, dry, blackhead prone skin, this toner DOES IT for me. Omg, my skin soakssss up all this juicy goodness. It feels like luxury-- a velvety opaque milky cotton candy liquid. Great price point. I do find myself using it quickly however. So luscious. Highly recommend for plush, dewy skin ;*",2
Been using this balm forever. So glad to find it in a travel friendly tube!!,2
"I do love this product. It removes everything on my face, I feel it.",2
I have been using this Eye Cream now for about 2 weeks.  I definitely notice that the puffiness under my eyes has been greatly reduced.  I haven’t noticed much of a difference in the black circles under my eyes though.  I am hoping after using it a little longer I will see some difference.  The product is a great consistency.,1
This is a great moisturizer for dry skin and redness. I definitely will be purchasing again. It lasts long as you only need a little amount for the full face!,2
"This is the best makeup remover purchase I have ever made! The balm does wonders at getting rid of all kinds of makeup - waterproof mascara, gel liner, liquid liner, etc. - without ever irritating my skin. I was initially nervous about the balm, as I have acne prone skin, but no worries there! The texture feels luxurious when I massage it around my face to get the foundation off, a little also goes a long way. I follow this with a gentle cleanser, and my skin just feels baby smooth. I will forever re-purchase this product.",2
"This is a great mask for rosea, very gentle and non-irritating.",2
I’m in my early 30s so I’ve been looking for a good serum to reduce some wrinkles appearance on my skin. I have a sensitive skin but this serum really works wonder and doesn’t leave redness after I apply it. In fact it gives the hydration and plump skin when I wake up in the AM!,2
Smells and feels very refreshing. Have seen a reduction in breakouts in just 1 week of use,2
"I bought this product in the smaller size, super excited to use as I had never gone out of my way to buy a toner and I LOVE the Fresh rose face mask, BUT after just 4 days of using this product my skin has broken out worse than it has in years! I gave it a chance, but on the second day it just went downhill. So disappointing. will be returning.",0
Saw this online and had to purchase it! The scrub leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed. I’ll be buying again.,1
The bottle is made from heavy glass and it doesn’t contain a lot of product inside. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and I’m running out. I need at least two pumps (comes out nice) of product to cover my face . The product is more on the watery side with no fragrance. I’m not sure if I saw my lines reduced but I don’t have many anyways. My face looks more refreshed and not as red and inflamed .,1
"I got this cleanser as a gift and I was super excited to try it, esp since I have oily and acne prone skin, I heard that this was perfect for it. So yeah I try it out and the smell is ok I guess?? Like lemons? Kinda smells like those cloths I disinfect my table with. And I attempt to lather it on my face to see that it doesn’t lather at all... This cleanser doesn’t seem like it’s cleaning your skin or anything, you think it would bc it’s called deep cleanse but no. After I wash it off my skin feels dry and a bit tight. Of course I wanna keep using this bc maybe my skin would get better but it didn’t. After 3 days my skin was irritated and it looked dehydrated and not as plump as it used to , also I broke out with huge bumps on my forehead ( I have acne prone skin, but it cleared immensely until I used this ) There are many and WAYY cheaper cleansers that work 38283x better than this... super disappointed.",0
"I have been using this product for a few weeks and I am pleased with the results. It makes my skin soft and I live the brightening it gives my face. If anyone is looking for a skincare product with Vitamin C benefits and brightening, I would recommend this product!!!",1
I’ve been dealing with hormonal acne for about 2 years and have really struggled for the last 6 months. This product was recommended but after about 5 months of use I’ve seen no results. I wouldn’t say it made my acne worse necessarily but it didn’t help with current breakouts or prevention. It is also very drying. It may have reduced acne scars but that’s hard to tell when you have active breakouts.,1
"This works so well, I noticed such a difference in my skin after just one week of using. Would definitely recommend",2
"I have rosacea and the occasional breakout. I have to be extremely careful of what I put on my face (as do a lot of us I’m sure!). My red, blotchy, uneven skin tone has been one of my biggest insecurities for a long time. My friend had recommended this product to me because it worked really well for her mom who also had a major problem with face redness. I pushed off trying it for the longest time because I was so driven to stay with all natural and more affordable prices. In the few days leading up to me giving in and getting the product, my skin had gone crazy. We’re talking major spots and breakouts. Little red bumps everywhere on my face and just overall redness. I was so frustrated and willing to try anything. With my first application, I kid you not, I could see a difference the next day. I thought it was too good to be true because that never happens with my skin. You don’t need to apply much product either because it spreads so nicely. It feels almost like a wet consistency at first, which is good for spreading and then it dries super quickly.It’s been about five days since I started using this product and my skin has never been so smooth looking and redness free. The bumps I usually have from rosacea are nowhere to be found and I haven’t had any breakouts whatsoever. I think this product is amazing and I had to let other people know that it’s worth the price.",2
I guess at first I didn’t read the bottle. I was putting this all over my face for about two weeks. After seeing no results I read the bottle and realized that it was for my eyes. So I added it to my eye routine and saw no difference. If anything my eyes feel more dehydrated. Thank goodness it was so cheap.,0
"I really love this oil cleanser as a first step in my double cleanse in my evening skincare routine. In both instances, I was wearing eltaMD spf, elf mattifying primer putty, hourglass vanish liquid foundation, Laura Mercier loose setting powder, CT airbrush powder, Natasha Denona Metropolis shadows, etc. In other words, I had a full glam face on! I do typically use bioderma on a cotton pad over my eyes as a pre-cleanse of sorts before any cleansing oil/balm. I found this oil took off all my makeup and didn’t leave a film or oiliness to my skin, but I also didn’t feel stripped. I always follow with an additional/second cleanser like FAB pure skin cleanser, Kate Somerville goat milk cleanser, etc. I should also mention that I use a damp microfiber cloth(Jordan Samuel or the rag co on amazon) to remove the oil after I have emulsified and further cleansed with the oil.",2
"I received a deluxe sample of this wonderful cream, it significantly improved my dry skin, gave me that natural healthy glow, it also cleared my skin, smells like citrus. Expensive but totally worth it.",2
"I had always hoped my acne would clear before my wrinkles developed. Alas, this was not to be. I have always had “congested“ skin. This is the best cleanser I have found so far. Thorough, but not harsh. No irritation from oils or fragrances. Some minor breakout at the beginning as stuff came to the surface, but such an improvement in skin clarity and tone.",2
I absolutely loved how this product worked on my skin! My skin is so sensitive to whatever product but this did not make my skin react in any way. So amazing!,2
Hydrating but has a crayon smell that I can’t get past. An okay cleanser. Better options on the market that do more for your skin.,1
Just perfect. Finally found the sunscreen that is easy to apply with out leaving my skin dry. Smells amazing and it leave my skin soft.,2
I buy this for my mom. She swears by it... and has used it since I was in High School... non greasy and this large size lasts for ever.,2
This is a great product for a great price. I tried it on the rough parts of my hands and it worked instantly. Bought it because I’ve read so many reviews and because of the great price. It definitely works.,2
Super easy application. Very convenient and portable. Great for travel. No Sticky mess. I use this in combination with Botox around my eyes. But I especially like it for under the eye where Botox isn’t used. Very happy with this purchase.,2
"After dealing with rosacea and discoloration my whole life, this product is honestly a godsend. There is slight white cast at first, but once completely blended in (with moisturizer) it disappears. I am on my second jar and will be repurchasing again.",2
"I’ve been using this product twice a week for about a month. I apply it to my t-zone at night in place of my normal toner. I leave it on for about 10 minutes, rinse, then moisturize. I’ve noticed reduced redness and oiliness in my t-zone which is a hard thing to do! I would definitely recommend this product if you have combination skin like I do!",2
Great eye gel cream. I absolutely love this product.,2
"Lovely cleanser! Very gentle for my sensitive skin, and has cleared up some problems but everything. Love the refreshing feeling!",1
"I received my WishfulSkin Yo Glow Enzyme Scrub through Influenster free for review, but this in no way sways my opinion.It claims to be “Gentle. Simple. Effective.” It has pineapple enzyme, papaya enzyme, AHA,",2
This is the only cleanser that takes away all my blackheads and leaves my skin feeling amazing and clean without the tight feeling.,2
"I received a sample of this product. I tried during a heavy winter month,  where I had recently spent a larger amount of time out in the elements in a large city.I did notice a lingering light scent which I believe was from the exclusive Mornings Extract & New Hibiscus Morning Bloom Extract. When I added my layer of foundation & powder,  the light scent basically resolved the slight annoyance. My skin did feel dewy for a longer duration during my day when used then my usual cream/firming lotion.  I am very fond of my previous creme but may switch over in the next coming month , after I utilize the rest of my sample.",1
"This really helps smooth,heal,even,and moisterize. Ive used it every day for a month now & someone just asked me if I was doing something new to my skin today (I had no makeup on), that it looked smoother and younger...proof enough for me!",2
Love this serum. My skin looks so good. You can see definite results. My skin looks brighter and well rested. It’s expensive so get a sample. I was surprised by the results!,2
If you are debating this product just do it. I have EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SKIN and this does not irritate me at all. It has virtually no scent. It works wonders. Price is well worth it.,2
"I would give this product a 4 stars.  It has a slight scent, but it is not overpowering.  As the product states, I would use this product at night.  I used this product every other night or twice a week.  When I first tried this product, my skin because red.  I was nervous because I have normal-to-dry skin and I was afraid of extreme flaking.  To my surprise, I didn’t flake at all.  I did apply a deep moisturize to combat the dryness, but there wasn’t any peeling when waking up the following morning.  After a couple uses, I did notice that my face felt smooth and soft.  I would recommend this product if you are not a fan of physical exfoliants, but I would be cautious if you have sensitive skin because using everyday is not recommended because it can cause irritations and dryness.  However, I would recommend this product to my family and friends.",1
This is moisturizing. I feel like it comes off sooner than the stick balms that Fresh makes.,1
"Dr. Brandt never disappoints me. I just started using this mask and it is amazing. You can feel how smooth your skin gets instantly. It absorbs very well and smells amazing, it is very refreshing as well. I’m in love with it.",2
This stuff is amazing  I love everything in this system,2
"2nd time purchasing this product and the container leaks every time I use it wasting the product.  At this price, I expect a container to work properly and not waste/expose the serum to air.  Sephora wouldn’t exchange past a 60 day window for a faulty product even though it was just opened - will not be purchasing again.",0
"So good!! Highly recommend!! It is a lip balm but looks like gloss, the best of both worlds!",2
"This is a nice milky, gel serum that dispenses from dual chambers to keep each formulation perfect. This felt nice on the skin & hydrating. This does have a very heavy perfume-like fragrance that I personally don’t enjoy. If you don’t mind fragrance in your skincare, this is otherwise very lovely!",1
Awesome product! I don’t love that it’s not a peel off mask but it’s nice to use in the shower or at night. The smell isn’t strong and makes my skin soo smooth! I have naturally oily skin and I feel like after using it just one time my skin was visibly improved. Recommend this product!,2
"By far my new favorite cleanser!I have very dry skin. I always liked their other cleanser (The Deep Cleanse) however, it dried me out. :( So when I saw this cleanser and how’s it’s more for dry skin I knew I was going to love it. And boooooy was I correct! This cleanser is amazing! It lathers super rich and foamy! But it doesn’t strip the skin at all! It leaves it soft and clean. I love it so much:) and I’m not shocked seeing all these amazing reviews! Tatcha did great with this product!",2
Love love love this! I’ve used it once and saw immediate change in my skin. I get really red in my cheeks and the morning after I used it I saw none! At first I was like “yea right” to those reviews where they wake up with “glowing skin”. But yup I had glowing skin. I’m going to try some other farmacy products since I’m already happy with this one.,2
"I really love this eye moisturizer. I apply it before I go to bed and skin around my eyes is smooth and fresh in the morning. It works well on my ultra dry, aging skin.",2
This mask is best after you’ve showered off a good face beat. It’s so smooth and leaves a great moisturizing feel. I received the product complimentary through Influenster and I will be going to purchase a full size product!,2
AMAZING. Made all of my skincare work so much better. You need this!,2
I received this eye cream from Influenster and Estée Lauder in exchange for my honest review. This cream feels really nice going on the eyes and absorbs quickly. I used it for about two weeks but didn’t not any immediate improvements during use or throughout the two weeks. In fact it caused little pimples under my eyes and I had to stop using. As soon as I stopped using they went away. I’m sure it would work for someone else but just isn’t the right cream for me.,1
"This creme is THE BEST!!! I have sensitive skin and often struggle to find products that don’t irritate my skin, and this one is AMAZING. I’d highly recommend this product to anyone. A HUGE thank you #olehenricksen and #influenster for the complimentary C-Rush Brightening Gel Creme!",2
"I got a sample of this in store, and I really do like the product. The best part about it is the smell, and it will leave your face soft, refreshed, but not oily. I’ve got combination skin, and it did well for that. However, I just don’t think it’s worth the price. The biggest selling point would be the scent, but other than that, what it does for my skin has been achieved by other products that cost a lot less.",1
So happy to get a larger size and I have severely dry lips. ￼￼ Sjogren’s is awful but this gives me relief. But I lost mine somehow and have to repurchase!,2
"I bought this product hoping it would be just as good as their regular CC cream, but unfortunately it fell flat for me.  It is definitely not medium to full coverage and it does not last long before it disappears.  I find the regular CC cream to be superior, however it is not oil free and I need to use non comedogenic products. Also, my under eye area reacted to this by becoming puffy.  The color of this is also not a direct match to the regular CC cream. So, light in the regular is not the same as light in this.",0
Wow I have to say as soon as you put on the cream which I concentrate right under my eyes because I’m getting wrinkles there. You can feel it starting to be firmer and smoother within a minute! It’s not a huge difference but I’m sure over time it would be great! I think this is going to be the best thing on the market I haven’t tried every cream out there but I’ve tried a couple and to me it’s the best one so far. I do think the jar is a little small but it does pack a big punch!,2
This product is really gentle and it definitely takes all my makeup off at the end of the day. I personally use this product as a gentle makeup remover and then do in with a more pore cleansing face wash like the Tatcha Deep Cleanse. I’ve been using this twice a day in the morning and then in the evening taking my makeup off. I for sure love the refreshing feeling that I get after using this product. Super impressed with it. Love it. love it. love it.,1
"I bought this a couple weeks ago and I am still undecided on this particular product. I thought it was a sulfur based acne treatment but there is also salicylic acid in it. The sulfur in it seems to make my acne go away, but the salicylic acid in it seems to make more pop up again.",1
I just put a few drops in my palm and lightly tap it into my skin. 10/10 would recommend. It doesn’t feel like much at first but my skin can tell right away when I don’t use it.,2
I had to keep reapplying this product all day. Dried my lips out even more.,0
"It’s a higher price, but you get so much bang for your buck. I just purchased the 230ml after trying out the 10ml sample size, and even the 10ml lasted me a few weeks. I only need 2-3 small squirts and it covers the whole face with ease.Cleaner, smoother, more evenly toned complexion after using it for a bit over a month now.",2
"This serum is great for an impaired moisture barrier. Everytime I use this overnight, I wake up and my skin is noticeably less red. It is pricey but definitely worth it. It sinks into the skin like water and makes me look so healthy!",2
"I just bought Summer Friday’s Jet Lag Mask & I’m impressed! There literally are multiple different ways to apply & use this product, and after only owning it for 2 days I’ve used it 3 times! I love it! So I bought this through Sephora, at $48 you get 2.25 Oz. The video describes a few different ways to use this mask:1.) Apply a heavy coat & leave on overnight 2.) Apply a light layer & use as a primer before makeup3.) A 10 minute Mask (at anytime) but on the video they recommend before you apply makeup4.) Apply as a spot mask - to under eyes or areas that are extra dry. When you use it as a full mask (and apply it on super thick) - it surprisingly melts into your skin and there’s no white cast - or evidence of the mask on your face. My husband watched me Apply this the very first time I used it (which was the same day it arrived) and I spared no expense & went full throttle- applying the thickest later possible. Well, after about a half hour or so, he asked “did you rinse off that mask?” I said “no, why?” He said it’s completely gone but your face looks like glass! This mask literally soaks in to the skin SO much so, that it leaves nothing behind except for the glowing, dewy skin look! I had no idea that this mask dissolved into your skin & left a radiant, natural glow. I was shook! I’m buying another because this is a daily moisturizer/mask for me! PRO TIP:Apply above & below your eyes with ease...this mask is extra gentle & it makes a immediate difference on your entire face, but my eyes look like I drank the amount of water I should be...:) Lastly, like I mentioned above, I already bought another tube because this is going to be a almost daily used product for me! Love, Sarah XoXo",2
"This is a great pre cleanser, so you do need to use a regular one after, but it literally melts whatever is on your face and rinses it away. You have to all the directions though and put this on your dry face and then wet it to wash it off. It has a scent but it’s not too strong so not to worry. Even the packaging is nice on this and the pump dispenser the right amount to use each time.",1
Says to steer clear of eyes.  Really?  Yet another face cleanser that you are not supposed to get near your eyes.  After experiencing a chalazion (like a stye) I can tell you that you definitely want to get the eye area cleansed every day.,0
"I got the DE products as my free birthday gift which included the polypeptide cream. I have combination skin, and when applying this moisturizer, it feels quite heavy on my skin. It doesn’t absorb in properly at first. My skin also feels oily after a few hours, but feels good for about2 hours after I apply it. I don’t really think I would buy this product, but will finish the bottle.",1
Something about this made my skin very red and irritated. A little burning sensation. I don’t get this from the regular liquid wash so I will return and go back to what I know works.,0
Best moisturizer ever! 100% recommend! Worth every penny,2
I LOOOOVE LOVE LOVE this cleanser! It smells super clean and its very natural. It helped a lot with my acne prone skin and calmed my skin down a LOT! I am sad because my bottle broke after 1 month of using it and I wasted all of my product pretty much so now I’m going to put it in a plastic bottle from another face wash to prevent that from happening again.,2
"Not sure what the hype is about? It’s obviously not your skin that’s pilling off (lol!). I’m someone that tries to be gentle to my skin which is why I choose to use chemical rather than physical exfoliators. However, the way this applies is quite rough on my face. Smell is quite strong for a ‘clean’ product.Ultimately my biggest criticism is that after using for a month, I don’t notice any difference.",1
"I love this!! I’m a teenager with breakout that can last a while, and this really helped me. I thought I would never get rid of those stubborn blemishes on my forehead, and I bought this to try it out. After using it for a while my pimples went away almost overnight!! Not only has it cleared my acne, but it has also prevented future pimples.",2
The best face oil I’ve ever tried. I love this product so much and it lasts for ever.,2
"Really nice night moisturizer. Leaves face feeling soft. Smells amazing. However, the jar is glass, but the lid is made of super cheap, thin plastic. The lid cracked within like one week. Now I have to keep the jar sealed in a ziplock bag, which is pretty ridiculous.",1
"I received a sample size of this product through Topbox circle #freeproduct to try on my mature skin. It was hydrating and absorbed into my under eyes, it left my skin smooth and plumped.It worked very well for a base under concealer. It has a light fragrance that quickly disappears.",2
Honestly this product has never failed me because I use it daily. I can tell when there is a difference when I don’t use it. It helps me especially in the morning. The scent and moisturizer works really well on me. I wish it came in a bigger container because I am already on my third one.,2
"I am in LOVE! I just purchased this after so many months of “loving” it. I am amazed! I have redness under and around my nose as well as some on my chin and forehead. I didn’t mean to use as much so I used some around my eyes were I have some darkness. As you can see, it evens out my skin and leaves a smooth, velvety finish. It smells great too!",2
This is awesome. I have had severely chapped lips and literally have every lip product out there. Used this less than a week and my lips feel amazing!,2
"I really put some time into trying this product for results, before leaving a review because who can argue with true results right? That is what you will get with SK-II Facial Treatment Essence. Real results! It left my skin luminous and with plump young looking skin.! There is a hang up unfortunately, as it is a bit sticky after application (even with the moisturizer) I found myself wetting a cloth later in the day and wiping my face. I’m still happy with my results thought!!",1
Love the texture & results,2
Just perfect! There is a “rough” side that helps exfoliate and there’s a soft side that just smooth perfectly.,1
God this as a sample a while ago and just tried it.  Amazing!  Skin felt so soft and smooth after.  Will be buying the full size when I am done with a similar product I am using.  Really love this one!,2
I like it I got a complementary for testing purposes end it really work for me if it real nice after using it and very healthy I wish I had this product before but it’s definitely a staple I’m going to become a staple in my routine.,1
"I love this stuff. If you have the time to add an essence to your skincare regimen, it’s definitely worth it. Essence basically just allows all the other skincare products you already use (serum, moisturizer, oils) to absorb deeper into the skin. This particular one is amazing. Tatcha just has the best ingredients for your skin. For me personally I feel like my skin is bouncier and fresh looking. It does take a while to absorb but there’s such a noticeable difference when you’ve been using it for a while. I use their new serum & water cream with this. It’s the best for my skin. I did receive this product complimentary from Influenster for an honest review.",2
Literally this has CHANGED my skin for the better!!!!! I have typically oily combination skin however recently I’ve been on the drier side so I need more hydration! I was a bit skeptical at first trying this product but I don’t regret buying this at all!!! My skin is SOOO smooth and radiant it’s crazy honestly! Best overnight face mask ever!!!,2
"I received a sample version of this product for free and I think it’s pretty interesting. I have never heard of probiotic moisturizer before. I was pleasantly surprised by the scent— it smells like almond extract— although some people may not like it. It was easy to apply and spreads very easily. The consistency is nice. I haven’t used it enough to see the effects on my skin long term, but it certainly does its job as a moisturizer.",1
"This is great if you have sensitive skin, however I do prefer the Ole Hendriksen walnut scrub.",1
received this product complimentary from Fresh. Really enjoying this lip balm. The color is a little off for my pigmented lips but looks so beautiful over nude lipstick. It’s been my go to ever since I received it mainly because it keeps my lips so moisturized.,2
Love...love...love it!!!,2
"I love love love this cream, received complimentary from Skinfix. First of all, the packaging is tops. It is packaged like a jar for easy storage but comes as a pump so air doesn’t get in to preserve the integrityof the ingredients. I use 2-3 pumps for my face and neck in my evening routine, after my serum. The texture is on the thicker side, but absorbs instantly into my skin. It has a slight oaty smell from the ingredients as there is no added fragrance.The ingredientslist is great, note that there is shea butter in this which my skin loves. I have not been using this long enough to tell long term effects, but this provides great hydration for my combo skin.",2
"I wanted to try this out since I heard so many good things but it just don’t work for me. Usually, I LOVE FAB but this made me breakout and my  skin did not brighten at all. If you have sensitive or  dry skin, you might wanna patch test.",0
this products smells amazing but it tends to leave my lips pretty dry and i found myself having to reapply several times throughout the day for the price of this balm i was expecting more !,1
I have really bad freckles so I wear sunscreen everyday even when it’s winter and overcast. I love that this is SPF 50 and it doesn’t leave a white cast on my face or arms. The scent isn’t that great but goes away quickly. Received this complimentary for review,2
"This is such a good lip balm. It’s unscented, hydrating and a little bit goes a long way! This keeps my lips soft and hydrated for hours! The applicator is on the larger size so if you have thinner lips, be careful with the application or you’ll end up with product outside of your lips.",2
"I’m 31, and don’t usually break out. All of a sudden I had a huge breakout on my face for whatever reason and nothing could bring it down. I have been using this for two weeks now and I’ve seen a lot of improvement. I will definitely be purchasing this again but I’m sure that will take a while because even this small bottle is lasting a long time",2
After using this the past week it has helped me so much! Coming from someone that has been biting my lips the past years. Gross I know. Definitely buying this again.,2
"This moisturizer is amazing! I tried Tatchas entire line for dry skin and even the water cream. Their products caused me to break out and felt like it sat on my skin. I saw immediate results with this moisturizer. I’ve been using it now for a month and my skin is firmer, softer and I have no more rosacea. I also found I use less than when I first started using it. Also the packaging is perfect and is clearly made for this product to remain optimal.",2
Works AMAZING. I have extremely dry skin and it has really helped. A bit oily but that’s what I need for my skin. I love the smell. It’s lemony.,2
this lip sleeping mask is amazing. it makes your lip so soft. you feel you got hard lips just put a dab of this product on and let it absorb.,2
"I use this to spot treat acne and omg it’s life changing. 3rd time buying this, it will last you for a couple a months since a little goes a long way. Helped a lot w/ my dark circles as well. Def worth the try.",2
This product is amazing. Love that it’s not too thick. Hydrates my skin really well. Makes my skin super soft. Just need to ensure to use the right amount. If you use too much it does tend to get a bit sticky on my skin.,1
I recieved a free sample from Pinchme and I’m glad I did!! I can tell a difference already with my pores and I’ve only been using this product 1 week!!! I will be purchasing this product as part of my skin care regiment,2
I received this product at no cost from IT cosmetics to review. I love that ut has 40 spf and that it is so lightweight. It dries smoothly and is full coverage. A little bit goes a long ling way so dont have a hand hand when putting it on. It blends nicely! It was a perfect color match for me and I have light medium skin tone. It lasted throughout my 13 hr busy work shift while running around and staying active. never had to reapply and I have oily skin so I was surprised it lasted so long. It is a great amount of product so it will last you a long time. Very happy with the product and I will be purchasing again when I run out of product. I have been telling everyone about this because it is amazing!!,2
I’ve been using this everyday since November and I’m currently in my second bottle. I’ve noticed and overall improvement in my skin. Will definitely continue to purchase!,2
I’ve been using this for years! It has helped clear my break outs and I don’t plan on stopping to use it anytime soon!,2
love the lightweight feeling of this lotion. great for daily use on combo/oily skin. Skin feels cool and refreshed.,1
"Most reviews were wonderful for these products, sooo sad they didn’t work for me ): first few days my skin looked plump and amazing, but then all I got was a hugeeee breakout all over my forehead and made my dry skin worse. If you are acne prone, ask for a sample first, they will be happy to give you one!",0
"Honestly, i didn’t think I was going to like this product because I saw it everywhere and thought it’s just another overhyped product. I held off on purchasing it for so long but this with thermal water makes your skin feel so nice and plump.",2
I had the pleasure of being given this product free from a contest by Influenster,1
Not a KVD supporter so chose this as my insider bday gift. Oh my. It has done wonders for my skin and I am a complexion queen. I can see the sample lasting months since a little goes a long way due to the jelly texture. Cleansing and hydrating without hurting my super sensitive skin!,2
I’m about 3 days in and I find the product to be really lightweight but effectively hydrating the surface of the skin for up to 12 hours it’s a wonderful primer for underneath my makeup and has built a better barrier between my makeup in my skin than my actual primer. I prefer the scented the serum over the Hydrating Lotion but as a combination both products are refreshing and effective even within 3 days,1
I got this as a sample and used it under makeup. My foundation was smooth and flawless! No primer was needed. Its one of the rare face creams that go well under foundation. It is a bit overpriced but I  am considering buying the full sized one.,1
"Brought it multiple times and it has become over the years one of my favorite moisturizers. The creamy texture and how light it is on the skin make it a must for me. The only con is that it is a bit too rich for oily skin thus I don’t apply it on my T zone. Overall this brand never disappoints me, the product is great and I like the fact that it comes with a little “spoon“ to scoop the product.",1
I have a good skin not dry and not oily but because of the extreme cold weather i got a very very dry skin. I used this and BOOOM all the dryness was gone and i was back to my normal skin!!! Wow!,2
i love all Peter Thomas Roth products and this one is no different. it rolls on my skin making it look clearer and cleaner,2
I’ve looked for years for something to fade those “fused freckles“ that are forming on my face. I saw noticable fading within 2 weeks even though the staff at Sephora said it may take up to 6 weeks before fading occurred. One of my girl friends that I hadn’t seen in a month saw me after about 4 weeks of starting to use this product and exclaimed OMG where did all your freckles go. I’m definately hooked on this serum,2
"I’ve use this product for a few weeks now I don’t notice much difference in my pour size, and I noticed it was rather sticky when it’s applied. I think it smells good but I personally would not buy this product. This was a free product to try and review.",1
"I like this product. It doesn’t have a perfume smell and that is great. The pump on the bottle is awesome too, I wasn’t expecting that. It’s a very light cream and it seems hydrating. I have been using it everyday",2
"This sunscreen was oily on my face. Its consistency is thin, liquid-y and has a tint. It absorbs quickly but leaves a slight white cast at first when you apply but it goes away after few minutes. It does a slight Pledge-y lemony smell but it doesn’t linger around. It also has hyaluronic acid so it retains moisture throughout the day. I’ve combo skin and I didn’t like it even though it’s a oil free sunscreen. It definitely does not feel heavy on skin but light. I don’t mind this sunscreen if I’ve no other to wear but it’s not my 1st choice.",0
"use this product every morning on my face and neck - makes my skin plump and youthful. i like that it dries fairly quickly so i can use my other products on top of it without waiting a long time. i would recommend, even though the price is HEFTY",2
"I purchased the mini size just to test before I dove right in and purchased the larger one, and boy I’m glad I did. I like the texture and the way it feels on my face I just don’t like the way it makes my face feel after washing it off. It makes my face super dry to the point where as soon as I pat it dry it instantly feels tight. I’m dry so maybe thats why, this may be better for someone who has way more oily skin.",0
I like this product. I put a light layer on before my moisturizer at night and in the am. It does seem to hydrate and soften my skin. My skin looks better overall from using this. I only use this on my face and lips but it would probably work anywhere that needs hydration.,2
This smells so good it actually smells like a rose which i love and my skin feel so much more soft and not dry and it didn’t irritate my skin at all and i have sensitive skin and its easy to use it does give my skin the hydration it needs thank you fresh again for sending me this product as a gift for my honest review back in return,1
Pump never worked.  Didn’t stand behind the product and made it very difficult to return.  For this price it should work and they should stand behind the product.   Neither happened.   Stay away,0
"I can see why this is called magic cream!  It is very hydrating and absorbs very nicely into the skin.Prior to this I was using gel moisturizers and since this is a cream, it felt heavier on my skin, but once it is absorbed it feels fine.  It has no distinct smell which is nice because sometimes fragrances can irritate my skin.A little bit goes a long way so one container will last more than you would think.  I highly recommend this cream!!I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and the opinions stated here are my own.",1
I have had tons of issues due to skin sensitivity and redness and this saved my life. My skin was combo and so annoying. This made everything better. Cannot recommend enough!,2
"This literally melts the dirt away, I love it. It leaves my skin feeling well moisturized, now I want one for my body!",2
"The rough side is really rough! Which I love! It’s more more exfoliating than I expected. So if there’s ever a time I can’t wash my face, this comes in handy.",2
Received this In my trendmood box and it is so nice and great to refresh the skin.,2
This is the weirdest consistency that I’ve ever experienced. It feels like a regular cream at first then while applying it it starts to feel thicker like it’s dragging across my skin. Then the texture suddenly becomes watery. It even leaves what looks like white casts. Once it dries down it feels normal. But this is the weirdest thing ever and it made me want to return it immediately.,0
I love this face wash for the hotter months of the year when my skin gets more oily. Has helped to balance my skin out. I don’t break out often but this has almost completely eliminated any breakouts. Love it! Works great on the Boscia cognac sponge.,2
"La Mer gifted me this Creme de La Mer in exchange for my honest review. This cream feels very luxurious to use and made my skin feel great. I was afraid that it would be too oily, but when applied correctly by warming in my fingertips, I did not have any issues. Coming out of the winter months my skin always feels dry and this cream certainly helped hydrate and smooth my problem areas.",2
"Strong floral fragrance.  Not horrible but if you’re sensitive this is not it. The serum is silky and glides over skin easily.  Face felt hydrated and defiantly showed. However, due to its oily residue I used in the PM. I enjoyed this product for the effects it has on my appearance. I looked youthful and glowing first week. I received this product as a free sample.",1
"I love this product. I’m very critical with expensive skin products as I think a large majority of them have questionable ingredients, efficacy and make a majority of their sales through excessive marketing (see most luxury face oils and HG instagram products) but Drunk Elephant is not among those. I have tried the b-hydra and la la retro and neither were worth the price to me, but I love a majority of their other products and wanted to give Protini a chance. I’m so glad I did! It’s not too heavy like la la retro but also doesn’t require other products like b-hydra. My skin looks plump and restored after use. No issues under makeup and no breakouts. I have issues with moisturizers causing closed comedones and this has given me none whatsoever. This is worth the investment and I honestly consider this a new HG of my routine. I wouldn’t give it five stars just because it’s Drunk Elephant BUT because Protini is exactly what they were missing in their line. I love it.",2
"This moisturizer is amazing.   If you have sensitive dry skin as I do you will feel the match the first time you try it on.   It goes right into the skin and feels so light, I am in love! I got a sample during Christmas and I knew right away I have to order a jar.  The only thing that is a down is that the jar is fairly small for the price.",2
Didn’t stand out as a high end moisturizer or worth the price. This didn’t break out my sensitive skin so that’s why it gets 3 stars. It is comparable to many of my drugstore moisturizers but way more expensive. Not impressed at all.,1
I was gifted by Dermalogica Sampling. I have used it for 7 days straight. My skin got brighter! I have sensitive skin and it’s very gentle to my skin. it does help to exfoliate the dead skin and there’s skin peeling. But I can’t apply the foundation during the peeling process since it causes caking. I recommend doing a facial every other day during the process because it dries off my skin. But I love that it’s able to clear my dead skin,1
"cant go a day without it, very moisturizing and doesn’t feel thick",2
I wanted to love this cleanser. It smells wonderful and is one of the few to explicitly state that it’s ph-neutral. So I was surprised that the micro-exfoliators strip my aging combination skin. Not recommended for older women.,1
Skin broke out more. Wish it helped but it is what it isn,0
"I have combo. skin but I read about the oatmeal and thought this would be good try. It’s amazing, it really absorbs in a snap and its not greasy at all and I have a face picking “issue“ and I tend to leave marks, it sooths these areas and heals them so quickly. For the price everyone should try it!",2
I got this as a sample and I love it! It makes your skin so glowy and hydrated. I’ll definitely be buying the full size when my sample runs out.,2
"Best facial cotton, doesn’t leave any lint behind. Also doesn’t disintegrate and holds up very well with any toner. Cut in half to get double the quantity!",2
"Work well for me, will buy it again.",1
"As everyone else has said, this dos the job of removing your makeup! Even waterproof mascara!I like to massage this on my cheeks and forehead first to remove foundation, and then on my eyes to remove eyeliner/mascara. Usually when I put any cleansing products on my eyes, it stings. BUT NOT THIS PRODUCT! I rubbed this on my eyes, then opened them to make sure it was working. Lo and behold, my eyes felt nothing. It’s super easy to use. I follow up with facial cleanser and my skin has never felt cleaner.",2
"I have combination skin and this product made my skin develop cystic acne on my chin. My skin is also sensitive. This just wasn’t for me, but I know this line works well for others.",0
"Love this salve and it’s hard to find- so glad they carry it! Perfect for lips, elbows and knees and anywhere else you have rough spots.",2
This product washes off eye makeup really well and leaves a clean finish without drying or irritating the area. I gave it one less star because it is good on the skin but does dry me out a little bit.,1
Iam loving the results already I can see a difference.,2
"I have been using this product everyday, with or without makeup, for over a year and I love it! I like that it’s clear and works as both SPF and a makeup primer. I used to use Neutrogena clear face sunscreen, which left a sticky shiny residue, then layer Smashbox photo finish primer on top before makeup. The layering felt heavy sometimes. With this, I only need one product to do both and feel lighter on my skin. For traveling and daily morning routines, it is more convenient to only need one product instead of two. It applies with a matte-to-natural finish in the morning, but after 5+ hours at work in front of a computer it starts to shine a bit. I just blot and my makeup stays in place and doesn’t transfer or fade. My face has never gotten sunburnt while wearing this. 9.8/10 highly recommend",2
"My face looks brighter, smoother, and glowing. Loving this product, very good if using with the ordinary moisturizer",2
Amazing product! I love that PH is formulated correctly for exfoliation and there are no unnecessary ingredients.  Product has helped immensely with fine lines and pores and overall condition of my skin. Pump Packaging is a huge plus to keep ingredients stable.,2
"I keep having to reapply it every 10 minutes. Besides from that, the color is so pretty and the smell isn’t too strong. Even though I have to reapply it, it’s lasted me quite awhile.",1
Loved it! As I’m getting older I realize more fine lines starting to come in and this cream is perfect. It smells great and feels so good on my face. It’s so moisturizing!,2
"I’ve received this as a free sample from Influenster and my initial impression is that’s it’s lovely not greasy it soaks into the skin quickly. It hydrates and makes the skin feels so soft. It is not a heavy serum, it’s very light.",2
"I love the soft and dewy way my skin feels after applying, but its been a week now and I am beginning to noticeably break out. The smell and texture are nice but this product is just not agreeing with my skin. I used it many years ago with no problems but I think my mid-40’s skin is a bit more sensitive. I’m going to try the gel version out to see if that is better.",1
"This has changed my skin!!! I’ve been using it nightly for about a month, and I’ve noticed my skin is so much smoother and the product allows my skin to resurface overnight. My skin would always get irritated and dry whenever I used physical exfoliants, so this product is definitely a game changer for me.  I definitely would recommend this as a starting point for using chemical exfoliants. I also have pretty sensitive skin and redness and this did not irritate my skin at all! This honestly changed my skin, and the price makes it even better :)",2
This moisturizer helped my skin so much. I was having so many problems with dryness and peeling in some places but also hormonal acne. This moisturizer is gold. It’s heavy enough to moisturize dry skin but not so heavy that it exacerbated my hormonal acne issues. Truly the perfect formula. It has been one change that has helped me dramatically improve my skin!,2
"I liked this product a lot, it’s relatively light weight and I am a big fan of a TON of glow. I wish this was a little more tinted and came in different shades but that’s not why I am giving it two stars. This is the second supergoop product I’ve tried this year that has broken me out (the first being the cc cream with very different active ingredients) and I am not someone who has breakout prone skin. A real bummer I will have to return this one as well.",0
"I love the smell of Estee Luder products, but I didn’t notice any changes. I received a small sample size, so perhaps with continued use I may have had a better experience. It’s a thick cream which takes a while to not feel sticky. I prefer having moisture with a naked skin feel over feeling a residue.",0
Really gorgeous base for makeup! It glides in so smoothly and just feels as luxurious as it looks. Very hydrating and keeps the skin plump so amazing for this cold winter weather! I would use sparingly if you have combo oily skin like I do!,2
I’ve been using this product for a little over a week now. I notice a visible difference after. My skin is much brighter and it definitely helps even out the redness in my skin.,1
"Feels more like a moisturizing night cream than a “mask“, but still really liked this product. Has a nice cool feeling when you put it on, not too greasy, and instantly hydrates your skin. Would definitely recommend this as a night moisturizer. I tried this product for free.",1
SO obsessed. I love the smell and the results of this serum. I have only really ever used samples of face/brightening serums and they were never great enough for me to want to use regularly. I LOVE how this makes my skin feel and look ◡̈,2
"I got a sample of the TopBox anti-wrinkle eye cream. I liked the texture, it’s light. Having a small sample it is difficult to talk about the long term operation. I put a little in the morning and evening. At the moment it’s refreshing. #freeproduct",2
"ok so i should start off by saying that i’ve never left a review in my life. i saw this cleanser on an IG story and i needed something new anyways, so i picked it up one day. oh my god. i don’t even know what’s in this but it’s amazing. my skin was noticeably clearer, even, more supple, with less noticeable pores, right after using it. like honestly this stuff is like magic. i’ve been using it for a little less than two weeks and my skin is glowing, it makes me want to wash my face just to see the results, and there’s a noticeable difference to my skin if i don’t use it. i have found my holy grail! p.s. i have combination/oily skin with hormonal breakouts!",2
This product is “okay”. Have to use a lot of it. Hard to tell if makeup is really “off”. Way rather use a makeup remover wipe instead.,0
"O. M. G!!! I’ve been sent lots of skincare, some of it’s been amazing and some has just been ok. I have been using this pre-makeup application and the results of my skin are just incredible! The two part instructions were a bit intriguing to me since one bottle is a powder and the other is a serum, but after finding out that they separate the two so your product doesn’t bleed expire as quickly is genius. They leave it to you to pour the serum into the powder, shake, place into the dispenser and use. My skin was glowing and firm as can be! This has been my favorite vitamin C serum I’ve used thus far and I plan on picking up a bottle when I run out. I didn’t pay for this, it was sent to me courtesy of influenster but I plan on paying to replace when I need to. If you need an amazing vitamin C serum, THIS. IS. IT!! Run, don’t walk!",2
"Before I begin, let me say... Yes, this does everything it claims. That said, I’ve noticed no difference in my skin after using this for quite a while. Why is that? Well, before I tried it, I’d already been using a separate AHA serum, a BHA treatment, and a Vitamin C serum regularly for over two years, and I’m pretty happy with the results of doing so. This merely produces the same results for me. So I’m giving four stars because it does in fact work. Where I’m holding back a star is the price point. While this does provide the same result in just one bottle, it’s many times more expensive than what I’d pay for the other three together. I would also note that when using a product that combines all three acids, it’s not possible to customize your concentration of each as it would be if you purchased separate products, but for those looking for an all-in-one, this is a nice weekly treatment that will produce results.",1
"I love this product. Light weight, doesn’t leave a cast, and leaves your skin looking beautiful. I love that this product is for every skin tone also. It’s a great everyday product whether you’re staying home or on the go! I recommend this product for everyone.",2
"SUPER DRYING. I have oily skin and have some acne. I typically break out more during my period. I’ve heard really good reviews and decided to purchase it. WHAT A MISTAKE. The first day i washed my face, my face looked dry- peeling. It was the worst. I stopped using it for a month and tried it again because i was out of cleaner. Well, my face started peeling again. I stopped washing my face for three days in hopes that giving my face a break would make things better, it didnt. My face got better the fourth day. For those looking for a better product- TRY THE OLE H. IN THE GREEN BOTTLE! Ive used it twices and my acne went away and my pores got smaller.",0
I received this as a bday gift from Sephora. I will buy it. I love how clean my face is. This removes every drop of makeup without drying my face.,1
"This actually works! Whenever I feel a breakout or acne bump, I put this on & leave it overnight & next morning it has drawn out the impurities & my acne bump has reduced in size by a lot! I was skeptical at first, but now I’m a believer!!",2
Pinchme sent me a sample of bareminerals skinlongevity long life herb serum. It has a pleasant scent. It makes my skin feel good and was fine under my makeup. I didn’t get enough to tell If the claims are true. I liked it the two days I used it,1
"EEK! My first review! Let me start off by saying I find everyone’s reviews SO helpful in achieving my 2019 goal of nailing down my “holy grail“ beauty products/routine and downsizing my collection. Another one of my goals was to use more “clean“ beauty products, or at least educate myself as to what I am putting on my hair, face etc. everyday. With all this being said I CANNOT stress how truly AMAZING this product is on so many levels. I put this ALL over my face at the end of EVERY day I am wearing make up and WOW does it get rid of EVERYTHING! It really does just melt everything away, I find I don’t even have to wait for it to do so. I actually bought the smaller size, just in case I didn’t love it and WHOOPS I AM IN LOVE. With this being said, I actually think that smaller size will last me a LONG time (with using it basically EVERYDAY) as I find you don’t have to use a ton of product to get rid of your ENTIRE face of make up. WOW, I am at a loss for words - seriously INCREDIBLE stuff and formulated without SO, SO many things you don’t want in your products. Previous to this I was using the standard Neutrogena Wipes - which did do the job, but not like this AND it also produced SO much more waste/was much less cost efficient. BRAVO FARMACY! BRAVO, BRAVO, BRAVO!",2
it’ been two weeks everytime i used live my face nice n clean frest and softi have dry face irealy recommend this product,2
I used it basically as a night cream and woke up with skin that felt like a baby’s butt. Very happy I finally decided to splurge and get this product.,2
This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It is not oily and it smells amazing. I use this and the tartes 4 in 1 setting spray as a primer and my makeup looks and feels amazing all day long.,2
I actually really liked the way this made my skin look smooth and of course the sun protection from the spf. Unfortunately it made me break out really bad so I had to stop using it. I would recommend this to those that don’t have acne prone skin but if you do I would stay away from this.,0
"I use this every day, 2 x a day after I wash my face with the cleanser. I add a few drops in with my moisturizer and use it directly on extremely dry parts on my face ( around my nose, chin, in between my eye brows, etc) I also use it on my elbows and feet. I have kinky curly hair and have used this on my ends and to smooth frizz. Love this mostly for my face but its very versatile! Believe it or not it does not make my face more prone to breakouts or more oily. Don’t know it till ya try i! You’ll be addicted like me!",2
Not a whole lot of product. I have oily acne prone skin and this product made me break out. I did not think it hydrated my skin,0
"This moisturizer has a thick, creamy consistency. It reminds me of DE’s Lala Retro Whipped moisturizer and FAB’s Intense Skin Repair moisturizer. There is no scent and after I put it on my base looks hydrated and smooth. I think it’s the perfect moisturizer pre-makeup application as it creates a smooth, supple, and glowy skin base. I received this product complimentary for reviewing purposes.",2
I use the deep polish for about 6 months now and have great results. I use it about every other day as a gentle exfoliate. My skin feels very smooth and clean afterwards.,2
"This product is unlike anything else I’ve used! It is a stiffer balm that is best retrieved with the provided spatula, and it melts into such a water-like consistency that removes makeup with ease. I usually struggle with removing waterproof mascara but this balm made it easy!",2
"It is not an economic product for the price I expect some kind of result that I never saw. after using it for 8 months i did not see any result. I contacted the costumer service for this brand and said it did not remove the dark spot it just prevent it, This is not what the brand says at the time you buy it.",0
"the cutest packaging ever!!! my fav has lots of bumps ,kp , and it doesn’t completely get rid of them but it DEFINITLY soothes them and makes them less bumpy > it so moisturizeing ,10/10",2
"Its my favorite serum, tried 4 from other brands and had to go back. Thank u Sephora for such a quick efficient delivery!!!",2
"So at first I didn’t like this because I felt like it stripped my skin and brought all these pimples to the surface, but I noticed that my skin felt softer through the day after using it and after my pimples went away I haven’t had many new ones. I also really like the consistency because it doesn’t run all over the place. I hate when I feel like the soap disappears in my Mia and I don’t know what is on my face and on the handle. So far I really like it and I honestly thought this would be a dud.",2
"I wear glasses  in-between the times i wear contacts, and sometimes my eyes look a little puffy. I use this product and my skin roundly eyes look great.",2
"I’m always excited to try out a new acne hydrocolloid patch. This one did not disappoint! It’s easy to apply and I like the larger size since tbh it is often needed. It sucked the gunk right out! Didn’t fully heal my zit, as another head reformed… but still impressed. Definitely will be using now when I break out! Gifted by Peace Out Skincare",1
I love everything about the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream. This cream is feels really luxurious when applied. I love the texture and feels so moisturizing. Also gives my skin some extra glow that I need for the day.,1
Absolutely in love with this product! I am south asian and this is just the perfect touch of tan and gives it a beautiful glow to my skin. And bottle lasts forever!,2
"Honestly just such a good product to use for hydration anytime, I love mixing it with other products to keep my skin happy! Such a staple in my skincare routine even when I’m trying out new products, AND you can’t beat the price!",2
"I was skeptical of this mask at first, giving that I’ve used many chemical exfoliant masks before and have seen nice but not outstanding results.This product was gifted to me for testing purposes, my opinions are my own. Let me tell you this - GOOPGLOW is a totally different story! My skin felt so smooth and soft and continues to feel amazing days after I’ve used this mask! It’s truly wonderful - especially after my skin wasn’t at its best state after lots of flights and travel. I wasn’t a big fan of texture as it was a bit hard to spread and massage it in, but it was easy to rinse with a cloth and it didn’t leave my skin tight or uncomfortable. It was a little tingly but nothing major or again, uncomfortable. In fact, I enjoyed having this mask on - it doesn’t have a heavy fragrance, and I feel it’s actually working. I’d definitely recommend this mask to anyone looking for an exfoliant, giving the results AND the ingredients are amazing (ingredients are very important to me).",2
"I’m going to review on my one time use of this product because I did have a positive experience. Normally, I would wait awhile before I review, BUT if I continually use this product I’m sure the benefits will increase...So lets start with the application. The smell of the product is strong, but not unpleasant. It smells like you are using a heavy duty acne med from the dermatologist. I used the first step and rubbed it in circular motions on my face. I did so in quadrants. For example, the left corner i used for my forehead, right corner my left cheek and chin and so on... I also applied it to my neck.. you then let it dry for 2 mins and apply the same way with the second one. I didn’t sting or anything, and it dries very quickly. i did not apply a moisturizer afterwards because my face felt pretty nice. Right away i felt that my face was smoother. I slept and woke up and i noticed a few key differences: i had two zits on my cheek and one on my chin and they were almost completely gone. second: my skin looked more even and less blotchy. I did not notice a significant difference in pore size or scarring, but this was with one time use. So for that reason I give this 5 stars because i DO believe with daily use this will clear up skin entirely. I will review later on...",2
I really like this lip gloss/balm. It reminds me of a lighter version of the Laneige lip mask.,2
Love this balm! I’ve ordered it multiple times and will keep doing so.,2
THE SMELL IS ADDICTING. I look forward to using these wipes because the smell is heavenly. I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t burn me like other wipes tend to do.,2
"i’ve used the mighty patch patches for a while and liked them but it still left that little bump. however, this is like a spot treatment with a whitehead remover all in one. it’s perfect if you always pick at your acne bc it closes off the bump and works to minimize the redness and size. it is a little expensive, but i think it’s worth it.",2
Hydrating and refreshing.Your choice if you are not too concerned about it’s smell.,1
"Best moisturizer ever I have been using this product for the past 7 months and I have been hooked on it ever since. The smell is amazing. I started to use this product because I started Acutane and this was the only cream that hydrated my skin, though I do have to say I pair mine with the renewal oil and together they are match made in heaven. This product will always be a staple in my skincare routine.",2
"I have super oily skin, and my previous moisturizer was not cutting it.  I felt oily after 30-60 minutes!  After trying this product, I am able to go much longer without my face turning into oil city.  Very happy with this moisturizer!!",2
Gifted by Dermalogica I’m giving this Daily Microfoliant a 10/10 . I’m very impressed with the way it performed. I gave myself a few days of only trying this exfoliate and I’m so happy with how clean my skin looks. It removed all my dead skin . My skin looks and feels smoother . I definitely need to keep adding this to my skin care routine. Thank you so much Dermalogica.,2
I have very sensitive skin and this worked well without causing any reactions. It was light and didn’t leave any type of film. It’s refreshing and makes my skin feel fresh.,1
"best hidden gem ever! I had a cleanser like this before that I absolutely adored and could never find again after running out..This is a definite must have for someone like me who works in a dirty job. I never seemed to get the dirt quite out of my skin and scrubbing just made my skin quality poor! game changer with this product, immediate results... won’t ever be going without this one.... and so far there isn’t a Huda product I haven’t liked!",2
"I received this product for free for testing purposes and I was not expecting too much out of it because I haven’t seen any dramatic results from toners before. Upon opening it has a citrusy fresh scent that I love but it’s not too strong. I have used this product for a week and I’ve already seen results! It is gentle on the skin and for my combination skin, it didn’t dry it out and didn’t give me acne. it did however reduce the darkness of my scars and brighten up my skin! I am excited to continue using this product and perfecting my skin",2
I have been using this salve for over 10 years. Love the smell. I only have really used it for my lips!,1
"I love it! It’s not sticky, not runny and I don’t have to reapply every 10 minutes. My lips feel so soft and supple when I wear it. I’m a fan.",2
"I love this mask. I have very sensitive skin and this mask gave me no problems at all. I have very dry skin and I can tell its already made a difference. I’ve used it twice. I actually put it on before bed and slept in it the whole night, and I woke up to an amazing glow! this one is a keeper !!!",2
"Love this cream,  it’s thick and gives a skin a dewy glow",2
Really makes my skin super soft. The smell is kinda weird but I don’t mind it. I used the ELF gentle exfoliating peel but this is as good if not better then the elf product. Def worth the money!!,2
"Great smell, texture and consistency.  I find that it is a good moisturizer- not a great one.  If you are in an arid or dry climate, you may need something more intense.  Not a bad option for the price point, though!",1
"Heavy weight and hard to spread out but really hydrating. After applying this at night in the winter, my skin feels so soft in the morning. I wouldn’t recommend using this in summer.",1
"This is the only moisturizer I have ever used that actually fixes my dry, itchy, winter skin. Very soothing!",2
I received a sample to review for 2 weeks and I have using it and I absolutely love how my skin is turning I don’t have much wrinkles on my face and it’s getting so much clear and smooth.,2
I wanted to love this… I have a problem with the product peeling and trying to master the technique of patting it and being gentle requires a lot of time in my routine. Which isn’t ideal making this product not very ready and go friendly. I am also not even going to try to layer makeup on top of this product. Like it does look great in areas where the product and my skin cooperated.,1
"I have several Origins masks and this one is my favourite. I have combination skin, but I definitely have days where my skin feels really dry and my regular moisturizer isn’t cutting it. I love that I can put in on before bed and forget about, because it doesn’t need to be rinsed off; most of it absorbs into the skin throughout the night, so I can wake up to plump, hydrated skin. It’s a life-saver for dry skin!",2
I actually thought that this was only moisturizer when I bought it. I did not know it had make up in it. Obviously I am new to Sephora and I have only tried their almond foot mask and nose strip and that’s it. So when I applied this primer I kept getting compliments that my skin looked really good. Which I was confused by because I had no make up on (or so I thought.) After a few times of wearing it I realized it was a moisturizer and a primer. That’s what makes it pretty amazing because it’s not even noticeable that you are wearing it. It looks really natural and best of all it has never caused acne for me! I have super sensitive skin and can only use Aveeno products (some of them) so this was a real win for me. The only downside to this is that it is a little too light for my skin tone. I have fair skin so I am really pale so I am going to see if they have a darker shade next. :),2
"I am always wary of skin care products when I am pregnant. I was thrilled to see that the BareMinerals skin longevity serum is safe to use while pregnant! I love how fast this product absorbs into my skin. Immediately upon absorbing it feels weightless, and almost like it is tightening/plumping my skin full of moisture. It keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day without feeling oily.",2
love this mask! I’ve been using it for a few months now and it does make a difference. is really comfortable in my lips and confidante to sleep with. it’s not sticky at all just very buttery and soft. highly recommend,2
"This product is amazing! Holy Grail for taking the day off, so smooth and doesn’t leave a trace of makeup or oil!",2
I used Dr.Dennis Gross Skincare pore perfecting and Refining serum for approximately 7 days and I started to notice visible results around the 3rd day. My skin looked smoother and pores were smaller. I had a glow that I normally did not have. Highly recommend!,1
I am obsessed with this cream! It’s extremely light weight and melts into the skin. I have redness from acne scars and this cream looks like I’m wearing foundation. It provided the right amount of coverage for a “no-make up” look.,2
"It didn’t produce any immediate effects after I sprayed it on (i.e. no “instant burst of radiance“ or tighter pores), although I haven’t used it long enough to be able to say anything on potential long-term benefits.Sadly, I just can’t get over the smell - it reminds me too much of old Chinese medicine, so I’m going to return it :(",0
"This is a must for everyone no matter the skin type, and the pricing is amazing for the quality.  The serum sinks into your skin leaving no residue.  I was previously using the Tart Mermaid Skin Serum, but I find this product to be the exact same thing for 1/4th of the price",2
smells amazing. feels amazing on my skin.,2
"Just bought this. A little background. I have been a loyal and true belif user for 4 years+. I decided to give this a try considering it has vitamin c. Upon opening- texture is similar to the aqua gel face cream but with a slight tint of colour. Application amazing cool, gel and moisturizing. No fragrance or scent to it obviously. Will be using it out as a day cream and using the aqua gel cream at night and see how it goes. So far impressions are well. ** the product comes sealed right as it has a good amount of vitamin C!",1
I received this product complimentary of Influenster and it’s awesome! It feels nice and isn’t greasy and very relieving!,2
"Green Clean is a cleansing balm that can be purchased at Sephora for $34 and comes with 3.2 oz or 90 mL. It comes in a jar form because it’s a balm and has a spatula. The jar is white with a silver cap and doesn’t feel particularly fancy. Cleansing balms are meant to be used as a first step cleanser and followed up by a water-based cleanser. It is not meant to be the only thing used to cleanse your face and is for taking off makeup and sunscreen. When you open the jar, you will notice that the color is this light green that is quite pleasing to the eye. There is a scent to it that reminds me of sherbet. When you scoop the product and apply it to your face, it emulsifies instantly. I rub it around my face to take off all of my makeup, and it melts it all. When you rinse it away, the water has a milky color to it. I then follow up with a regular cleanser.I’ve tried Banila Co and Then I Met You cleansing balms.I’ve tried several liquid oil-based cleansers by Tatcha, FourthRay, DHC, etc.Green Clean is the most perfect formulation of an oil-based cleanser that I have ever tried because of the pleasant texture. It’s still manages to be light despite the fact that it is oil. I find that this is very agreeable for most skin types, but oily skin like mine would benefit from this. I’m impressed that Farmacy was able to create a cleansing balm that is actually a pleasure to use and feels so light. I’m going to be a lifelong fan.",2
"I liked the consistency and overall hydration of this product but I’m not sure it made a huge difference in the few weeks I used it.  Maybe with more consistent use over a few months time it would show better results. But In general I liked the feel of it on my skin, it was hydrating at minimum.",1
"I really like this product because I saw the difference in my skin just 2 weeks after. The only problem for me is that because I’m going through a difficult time right now and in great stress, so my skin seems to have a little reaction on the day I apply, then goes away the next day.",2
I’ve been looking for a cleanser that cleans my face and makes my face actually feel clean. Best product I’ve used and my favorite in my skin care regimen.,2
This product is awesome! Makes my skin feel wonderful! So refreshing!,2
I wanted to love this product but it was havoc on my skin. It made my skin look so dull!! It caused me to break out more than the normal purging stage and then the breakouts went away they left dark marks!!!! That has never been as issue for me before. I stopped use and my skin is glowy and clear.,0
"I recently had a rough dry patch on my eyelids due to cold weather and decided to try this one. It is very rich and thick, so although it may not appeal to everyone, it worked wonders on my dry skin!",2
"I originally purchased this product as a replacement for Glossier’s Super Bounce. After using this product for about a month and a half, I have hated every second of it. In stead of applying like a lightweight water type substance, it felt to me more like a cleanser. It lathers, takes forever to dry, and leaves my skin feeling excessively sticky. Somehow, it has made my skin much oilier, as well as feeling scaly, and dull looking. In addition, I have not had a breakout so bad in almost a year, from my forehead to my chin. During this time the only thing I had changed in my skincare was the serum I was using, from Super Bounce to The Ordinary. I have, today, purchased a new bottle of Super Bounce and I now know that the price is indeed worth it. Would not recommend.",0
I received this  commentary  product of Rose & Hyaluronic Acid Deep Hydration Moisturizer Reformulation for my review. Oh wow. Leaves your skin feeling absolutely amazing.  I use it day and night. Has a very nice scent. Doesnt leave the skin feeling sticky which is awesome. I highly recommend this brand and product.,2
I recieved a tester of this for free to review. I was a bit worried about if this would work or not because I’m up type of person who sleeps with my face to the pillow so I figured it would all rub off. However the next morning my lips felt quite smooth and after two nights use it works much better with one night’s use it was good but they were still dry they were smooth but dry not cracked. It is quite easy to put on very glossy and not very thick like Vaseline so that is nice.,1
"Tried this product, went through all of the spots and it didn’t really work at all. It was just like putting a sticker on my face. No result",0
I went into Sephora to but the Mario Bedescu (spelling?) acne treatment to find that Sephora did not carry this produce. I was helped by a VERY NICE sales lady who informed me the Kate Somerville made the same product. I was a bit aprehensive about buying this product #1. i have never used her products before and #2. it was a little bit more expensive. I have to say I am glad I decided to buy it. I actually like it better then the other brand I am used to buying. I’m 32 years old and for whatever reason i’m going through a stage of “teenage“ acne. This product dries much quicker then the other and I’ve noticed considerable less time in my ache going away. All in all...I’m glad I switched to this produce. I would buy it again.,1
I was excited when this product came in the spring things voxbox. I’ve been wanting to see if this product lived up to the hype. After the first time trying it it felt like it didn’t do much but I put it on again the next night and I woke up with super smooth lips. I love how much this product has improved the dryness and peeling I had before.,1
"I’m in love with the lotus Dream Night Cream! This has become my favorite final step in my skincare routine! This is a nice kinda thick rich cream which is so hydrating & refreshing! I wake up feeling so nice and skin so suple ! Definitely have seen some of my fine lines have started to fade or fill in. Also, love the soft natural scent in the cream! It also doesn’t feel tacky which I don’t like tacky creams in the evening. Im so happy i was sent this complementary to test out!",2
I love this cleanser! I received it with a purchase and fell in love. It is the best. Its the only cleanser I can double wash my face with. Which means I can use it first to remove my make up and wash my face again without it drying out my skin.,2
"The cleanser itself is great and smells incredible, my issue is the packaging and why I unfortunately won’t be buying again. 1. Scooping from a tub just isn’t convenient for a cleanser. Wish it was a squeeze tube or pump.2. It being a tub actually caused mold/mildew to grow within  probably 2 weeks of purchase. I keep it in the shower and apparently just opening the tub and allowing any water to get inside then causes mold/mildew to grow by closing the top. Smells horrible each time I open but refuse to toss because of the price. If the packaging was changed I’d likely keep buying.",1
"Removes all makeup, doesn’t leave your skin feeling dry or oily, and doesn’t irritate my eyes. A little goes a long way.",2
I almost never write reviews but these are INCREDIBLE. You can see and feel an immediate difference. Have sent them to all my friends and can’t recommend enough?,2
"I received a sample size of this to test out. I didn’t notice any major changes in my skin in the short amount of time I used it before running out. It does have a strong scent, just like most Estée Lauder products do. I needed a good amount to cover my face.",1
So nice to find something light and smooth for my dry/oily skin combo. I have sensitive skin and this does the trick!,2
"This toner definitely helps control oil! I have combination to oily skin snd I have really noticed a decrease in oil throughout the day. However this product does NOT layer well. After letting the toner dry, I have tried to apply my serum and moisturizer (on different days) and both would not absorb into the skin!! They would leave a white film and just spread around my face. I don’t like having to wait 20 minutes after applying this to be able to apply other products :(",1
"I was so excited to try this product but after using it for one night I will be returning. Unfortunately I cannot get past the smell. Even after i rewashed my face, the smell still lingered.",0
Honestly a must have for daily use !!! Bought my second bottle and it is absolutely amazing ! Leaves my skin really soft and gives me a natural glow ! With or without makeup ! Recommend to everyone !,2
"My skin is very combo and did NOT like this moisturizer, went back to Murad.",0
Really great smell and leaves my skin feeling fresh,2
"Received this as a sample and after using it twice, I’m sold. Immediately my skin felt clean and soft and had a nice glow to it. Not much of this product is needed, I applied it to my cheeks, chin and forehead and still have enough for at least 4 more applications. The reason I could t give it 5 stars is because it has an odd smell to it but aside from that this mask is excellent!",1
"This is a decent moisturizer, I like that it has a pump and a very light fragrance. It absorbs quickly on my combination oily skin but doesn’t give me much moisture. That’s ok for the Summer but I definitely will not use this in the winter where my skin needs more moisture.",1
"When I first applied this, I loved it because it felt super moisturizing and really good on my skin. Even the next morning my skin felt smooth and plump. BUT it broke me out like crazy with just one application and I know it was this moisturizer because it was the only new thing I added to my skincare. I really wanted to love it and had high hopes with all of the great reviews but not going to continue using this.",0
I received this product as a free sample. This is a very thick product and it goes on smooth but if you use too much product it gets hard to move the product on your face and neck. It takes a lot of effort to rinse the product off. Feels like it leaves a film on your skin. Do not like the smell of it. smells stale.,1
"This is a full cream that feels like something is happening when you put it on. I do have sensitive skin, so I do turn red but that fades quickly. I have been using intense skin treatments for hyper-pigmentation and this is keeping my skin sane.",2
"This moisturizer has been just ok for this past winter, but that is my fault since I should update my skincare routine as my dry skin takes over. What I really love this moisturizer for is in the summer when my skin is more on the combo side. The cream hydrates without greasiness and never irritates my sensitive skin. One star is taken off because the jar is very thick and so there is not the ideal amount of cream in the jar for the price.",1
"This is the best cleanser I have ever used. I will probably never try another one, because this does everything I need it to do and more. It takes your makeup off so easily and fast, I stopped buying makeup remover. The only I don’t like is that it smells like I am rubbing vegetables all over my face. Kinda weird.",2
"This product can be on the pricey side which is why I have it a 4 star, but as for the product itself- it’s great! I can tend to have sensitive skin, and this product didn’t irritate me. I felt smooth after application, my skin looked and felt clean, and the scent isn’t overbearing- it’s actually quite natural smelling.",1
"I’ve been wanting to try this essence for awhile, so I was happy to receive a sample size recently. The texture was light and quickly absorbed into my skin, but I wouldn’t describe it as hydrating. I used this in conjunction with the moisturizer and so I don’t know if it was one product or the combination of the two, but I’ve been breaking out since trying both. Sadly they’re not for me.",1
The fresh Rose mask is really good! My skin got so soft and silky! It is in my skincare routine now and I feel that helped my skin a lot. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.,1
"I loved this cream until this morning. I have been using this for less than 2 weeks and today it is empty. It is not cheap, but not enough product. I only used a drop both morning and night. It has no life.",2
I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I was really impressed with this serum! It instantly made my skin feel tighter and softer. It didn’t break my face out and really helped with some of the discoloration. My only criticism is the smell. Not fond of it. I do believe I would need to try this more than just a week to truly know how well I like it (I only received a week supply).,1
"So, I tried a free sample, and it has a nice smell and texture. Unfortunately, the skin around my nose and eyes was not very happy and it stung - probably because of the Vitamin C or a reaction to one of my other products. I’d hoped that since it wasn’t l-ascorbic acid that it would be in a form that didn’t bother my skin, but either the C or one of the other ingredients did not make my sensitive areas happy. Otherwise, the mask on my forehead and cheeks reacted much better and sank in quite well on my dry skin. My skin actually feels quite smooth and lovely, not greasy at all. I’d be willing to try it again to see if it’s the C or a reaction to another product.",1
"I enjoyed this face wash. It is creamy and works well for sensitive skin. But it has whey in the ingredient list. I have a sensitivity to whey in food but did not think it would be so bad in a face wash. I was wrong. About a week or so after using it, I reacted. Be careful if you have a whey sensitivity. It also has lactose, an ingredient some people are also sensitive to. But if I did not have the whey issue, this would have been a great choice - not stripping, non burning, fragrance free and luxurious feel.",1
I received this toner complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster and I am really liking it! I’ve tried lots of different toners to help calm my acne-prone and oily skin and this one really does a great job. It’s great at getting any makeup off that I missed during cleansing and has a super refreshing feel on my skin. I love the cooling/warming sensation I get from all of the products in this line and this is no exception! It really makes my skin feel super clean without drying it out which is key for me in a toner because my skin is pretty sensitive.,2
"I bought this on a whim and would have to say that this is my new holy grail lip care product. It leaves the lips feeling soft, healthy, and moisturized. This is great to wear at night and during the day. The smell is lovely!",2
